Additionally, many drug companies will work with your doctor or health care provider to supply free medicines to those in need.
Adolescence represents a window of opportunity to prepare for a healthy adult life.
Appropriate feeding practices stimulate bonding with the caregiver and psycho-social development.
As a further illustration of the importance of considering infection as well as diet in the interpretation of infant mortality rates, the findings of Martorell from Santa Maria Cauqué, Guatemala on the age-incidence of l illness are important.
As adolescents have a low prevalence of infections such as pneumonia and gastroenteritis compared with younger children.
As already emphasized in relation to mortality and morbidity, it is important to look separately at children in different age-ranges and not to group them all together.
As Jelliffe and Jelliffe have recently stated, sometimes a compulsive insistence on scientific investigation can delay proof of the obvious and thus impede the introduction of necessary preventive measures.
Assessment criteria may conveniently be discussed under four headings:, morbidity, growth, and finally, indices based on functional capacity.
Both Mata in Costa Rica and Tomkins in Nigeria have shown that the duration of an infection is much longer in a malnourished, than in a well-nourished, individual, even though the number of episodes may have been very similar.
Children have the right to a caring, protective environment and to nutritious food and basic health care to protect them from illness and promote growth and development.
Children who experience frequent episodes of acute , or have persistent , are more likely to become undernourished than children who experience fewer or shorter episodes of .
Children who were severely wasted and stunted had very high rates, but moderate degrees of stunting did not carry any extra risk.
Consequently the threshold or cut-off point at which the extra risk is appreciable varies with age.
Deaths from  are, in fact, usually associated with undernutrition.
Demographers have developed techniques for converting this level of information into more conventional statements about infant and child mortality.
is an important cause of undernutrition.
is, in reality, as much a nutritional disease as one of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and therapy is not adequate unless both aspects of the disease are treated.
Drug Prescription Assistance Programs provide free or low-cost medications to low-income individuals and families.
During adolescence, nutritional problems originating earlier in life can potentially be corrected, in addition to addressing current ones.
During pregnancy the most relevant anthropometric measurement is the amount of weight gained during its course.
Each episode of  can cause weight loss and growth faltering.
Feeding is a critical aspect of caring for infants and young children.
For a reliable check on incidence, observations really need to be made on the population sample at least every two weeks, and if the cause is also to be determined, this becomes a highly skilled and formidable undertaking.
For most children, lack of access to food is not the only cause of malnutrition.
For the United Kingdom the recommended amount is 12.5 kg (12), and it would be considered undesirable if the mean increment for a population fell below 10 kg.
Free Medical/Dental Clinics provides you with information about free clinics.
From the earliest stages of fetal development, at birth, and through infancy, childhood, adolescence and on into adulthood, proper food and good nutrition are essential for survival, physical growth, mental development, performance, productivity, health and well-being.
Hill-Burton facilities are hospitals and nursing homes that have received money from the federal government and now must provide a certain amount of free or reduced-cost health services every year to those who cannot pay.
However, in contrast to fluid replacement, nutritional management of  requires good feeding practices both during the illness and between episodes of , when the child is not sick.
If a woman is malnourished during pregnancy, or if her child is malnourished during the first two years of life, the child's physical and mental growth and development may be slowed.
If the decision is about the need for a feeding programme, then our ignorance about the causes and physiological significance of stunting is embarrassing.
Improved feeding practices to prevent or treat malnutrition could save 800,000 lives per year.
Improved health outcomes in young children have long-lasting health effects throughout the life-span, including increased performance and productivity, and reduced risk of certain non-communicable diseases.
In children who are undernourished as a result of inadequate feeding, previous l episodes, or both, acute l episodes are more severe.
In countries where kwashiorkor is the major form of protein-energy malnutrition, the measurement of plasma albumin is important, as is blood haemoglobin where there is anaemia.
In general, the impact of  on nutritional status is proportional to the number of days a child spends with  each year.
In general, these effects are proportional to the degree of undernutrition, being greatest when undernutrition is severe.
In Guatemala, by contrast, the corresponding figure was only about 25 per cent.
In hospitals where good management of dehydration is practised, virtually all mortality from  is in undernourished children.
In most populations the prevalence of wasting decreases after the first two years, while that of stunting increases.
In the Gambia, for example, McGregor has shown that prior to 1973, 50 per cent of rural children had died before the age of five years.
In the interpretation of mortality data it is obviously important to take into account the cause of death.
In the running of public health programmes there is always a danger of an overemphasis on and evaluation.
In turn, undernutrition contributes to the problem of .
Internationally there is evidence of quite dramatic decreases in infant and pre-school mortality rates in recent years.
Interpretation can be complicated by large swings in seasonal incidence, as observed in the Gambia, Nigeria, and Nepal.
It is also a timely period to shape and consolidate healthy eating and lifestyle behaviours, thereby preventing or postponing the onset of nutrition-related chronic diseases in adulthood.
It is only fair to conclude that, although a reduction in morbidity, particularly from l disease, could be a very relevant indicator of the success of a maternal-child intervention.
Malnourished children are, in turn, more vulnerable to disease and the vicious circle is established.
Malnutrition contributes to more than half of all childhood deaths, although it is rarely listed as the direct cause.
Measures of population dynamics are always more revealing than single assessments of mortality.
More information is needed about the significance of growth deficits.
More precise information can be obtained by measurements of growth velocity.
More than half of all child deaths are associated with malnutrition, which weakens the body's resistance to illness.
Moreover, if  occurs frequently, there may be too little time to "catch up" on growth between episodes, the result being a flattening of the normal growth curve.
Mortality is a very crude and extreme indicator of functional impairment.
Mortality rate, particularly infant mortality rate, is one of the classical public-health indices, and the one-to-four-year age-group mortality rate has frequently been used in comparative international surveys as an index of the prevalence of undernutrition in different countries.
Mothers can be asked questions such as, "How many children have you had, how many are still alive, and at what ages did they die?"
Much has been written about the assessment of nutritional status in infants and young children by anthropometry.
National Organization for Rare Disorders patient assistance program offers free medication to people who otherwise cannot afford their medications.
Nutrition is a fundamental pillar of human life, health and development across the entire life span.
On the other hand, Mata in more recent studies in Costa Rica, has shown a very clear relationship between infant mortality rate and deaths from diarrhea.
One also needs detailed information about the age at death. In the context of this report it is especially relevant to examine the distribution of deaths during the first year of life.
Patients must meet financial and other program specific criteria to be eligible for assistance.
Persistent  is also more frequent and dysentery is more severe.
Poor diet, frequent illness, and inadequate or inattentive care of young children can lead to malnutrition.
Poor feeding practices and infection, or a combination of the two, are both major factors of malnutrition. Infection – particularly frequent or persistent , pneumonia, measles and malaria – undermines nutritional status.
Poor feeding practices, such as inadequate breastfeeding, offering the wrong foods, giving insufficient quantities, and not ensuring that the child gets enough food, contribute to malnutrition.
Research is desperately needed in which anthropometric change is quantitatively related, both to the health and well-being of the mother, as well as to the success of the pregnancy and the subsequent growth and development of the baby.
Since in some countries up to 50 per cent of pre-school children may be classified as stunted by the usual criteria (height-for-age less than 90 per cent of reference), it becomes extremely important to know more about the cause and significance of stunting.
Some states provide prescription drug assistance to women who are not covered by Medicaid.
Some workers look upon stunting as a successful adaptation to a shortage of food, although not successful enough for the child to overcome completely the changes in his environment.
States and eligible U.S. projects serve eligible patients up to and including age 18 years, providing routine immunizations with little to no out-of-pocket costs.
The final event may be a particularly severe or prolonged episode of  or, when severe undernutrition is present, another serious infection such as pneumonia.
The most meaningful measurements are weight-for-height and thigh circumference.
The number of variables and the resources required, the approach is more suitable as a research tool than for the routine assessment of a public health programme.
The PAHO survey in Latin America and the Caribbean showed than in most of the areas studied, about twice as many deaths occurred between one and six months as between six and twelve months.
The peak morbidity occurs between six and twelve months, i.e. after the peak of mortality, suggesting that weanling  is not the major cause of the high infant mortality.
The reason we have to concern ourselves with assessment, however, is that resources are becoming increasingly limited, and it is necessary to know what we have achieved and what we have failed to achieve.
The relation between nutritional state and malaria is complex; both adversely affect total immune competence.
The risk of dying from an episode of persistent  or dysentery is considerably increased when a child is already undernourished.
The usual cross-sectional approach is, however, relatively insensitive to change unless it is dramatic.
There are nutritional issues, which are adolescent-specific, and which call for specific strategies and approaches.
There is an additional reason for this in anthropometric assessment.
There is no use in having an indicator unless it is useful for making decisions.
They lead to improved nutrition and physical growth, reduced susceptibility to common childhood infections and better resistance to cope with them.
This cannot be made up when the child is older – it will affect the child for the rest of his or her life.
This is because nutrient requirements are increased during , as during other infectious diseases, whereas nutrient intake and absorption are usually decreased.
This naturally requires longitudinal measures, but the advantage is that quite small samples can give meaningful results.
Thus,  and undernutrition combine to form a vicious circle which, if it is not broken, can eventually result in death.
To be realistic, however, it will be some time before there are completely reliable statistics for most developing countries, but even quite simple retrospective studies on relatively small samples can be valuable.
To get an accurate estimate of the incidence and severity of diseases that may be related to nutritional state is obviously difficult; l disease is the condition that has received most attention in so far as the young child is concerned.
To safeguard the nutritional health of women during their reproductive age, it is important to consider pre-pregnant status as well as that during pregnancy and lactation.
Vaccines for Children Program helps families by providing free vaccines to doctors who serve eligible children and is administered at the national level by the CDC.
We also need to know not only the frequency of episodes of infection but also their duration, which is an important indicator of severity.
Whatever the reason, it does emphasize that mortality as an indicator of nutritional status can be a very blunt instrument without additional knowledge concerning specific causes.
When this is done, and undernutrition is either prevented or corrected, the risk of death from a future episode of  is greatly reduced.
You may apply for Hill-Burton assistance at any time before or after you receive care by simply asking for Hill-Burton assistance.
100% immunization coverage against measles is the programme goal.
13-month calendar, corresponding to the 13 Facts for Life messages, makes life-saving information easily available to everyone.
40% of both mothers and children in Maharashtra, India are chronically undernourished, and under-five mortality occurs at 58 deaths per 1000 live births, or 1 in every 17 children.

Behaviour change techniques, including social marketing, community mobilization, motivational interviewing, communication, and education, to increase awareness of the link between contaminated water and disease.
But is this feasible? Packets of oral rehydration salts (ORS) are not universally available and the simpler sugar-salt solution can have dangerous effects if it is improperly mixed or administered.
Cereal-based ORT can overcome both of these disadvantages by providing yet another option for oral rehydration therapy.

Health workers will be trained to use these practices, and will convey the techniques to mothers.
If a woman is malnourished during pregnancy, or if her child is malnourished during the first two years of life, the child's physical and mental growth and development may be slowed.
If mothers could recognize and treat dehydration early on at home, the great majority of children would not need additional medical care.
If nutritional intake is inadequate, the consequences persist throughout life.
If this is not possible, maximum efforts should continue towards this end and, in the meantime, as complete a formulation as possibly should be used, recognizing its limitations.
Improved feeding practices to prevent or treat malnutrition could save 800,000 lives per year.
Improved health outcomes in young children have long-lasting health effects throughout the life-span, including increased performance and productivity, and reduced risk of certain non-communicable diseases.

It is also a timely period to shape and consolidate healthy eating and lifestyle behaviours, thereby preventing or postponing the onset of nutrition-related chronic diseases in adulthood.
Lack of clear policy focus on areas with greatest levels of malnutrition.
Malnourished children are less likely to perform well in school and more likely to grow into malnourished adults, at greater risk of disease and early death.
Malnourished children are, in turn, more vulnerable to disease and the vicious circle is established.
Malnutrition can result from suboptimal breastfeeding practices, poor quality complementary foods, detrimental feeding practices, and contamination of complementary food and feeding utensils.
Malnutrition contributes to more than half of all childhood deaths, although it is rarely listed as the direct cause.
Malnutrition in children is not affected by food intake alone.
Malnutrition in early childhood has serious, long-term consequences because it impedes motor, sensory, cognitive, social and emotional development.
Malnutrition is also influenced by access to health services, quality of care for the child and pregnant mother as well as good hygiene practices.
Malnutrition is more common in India than in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Malnutrition limits development and the capacity to learn.
More than half of all child deaths are associated with malnutrition, which weakens the body's resistance to illness.

The Indian government has launched a focused campaign to increase the households in the country that have toilets by 2010.
The objective is to make water safe through disinfection and safe storage at the point of use.
The prevalence of malnutrition varies across states, with Madhya Pradesh recording the highest rate (55 per cent) and Kerala among the lowest (27 per cent).
The routine use of any special infant formula (lactose-free products) for diarrhoea cases should be strongly discouraged as they are only rarely necessary and are costly.
The second half of an infant's first year is an especially vulnerable time because infants are learning to eat and must be fed soft foods frequently and patiently.
There are nutritional issues, which are adolescent-specific, and which call for specific -strategies and approaches.
They lead to improved nutrition and physical growth, reduced susceptibility to common childhood infections and better resistance to cope with them.
This cannot be made up when the child is older – it will affect the child for the rest of his or her life.
Through focused and integrated campaigns, and through partnerships with local manufacturers, we will increase availability of zinc supplements.
To ensure the sufficient availability of soap, partnerships with local manufacturers will be used to promote this practice.

When potassium is a missing ingredient, patients should be encouraged to drink fluids that are rich in potassium (fruit juices).
While only 41% of mothers in Maharashtra can correctly identify symptoms suggesting a child needs medical treatment for dehydration, 77% take a child with diarrhoea to a health facility.
With appropriate complementary feeding from six months and continued breastfeeding for two years or beyond, with supplementation of vitamin A and other micronutrients are needed.
A child that functions according to the equivalent modus only, doesn’t experience a difference between reality and fantasy.
A child’s development of self-regulating mechanisms and ability to mentalise (which, when taken together are called Interpersonal Interpretative Function, IIF) are dependent on their “early attachment relation”.
A modified version has been introduced for birth parents, which is currently being tested in a small group.
According to the developers the goal of the project is to develop a theory- and evidence-based intervention protocol that can be used in a partnership between professionals trained in scientifically based attachment procedures.
Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of socioemotional development with one of the broadest, deepest research lines in modern psychology.
Although such interventions share some approaches, treatment methods can be quite different from each other.
An important concept is “the ability to mentalise”.
An overwhelming flow of anxiety for instance can cause the child to fall back in to an equivalent modus of operating.
As this ‘mentalization process’ develops the child functions in the pretend modus and is capable of using symbolic representations.
Attachment theory has, until recently, been less clinically applied than theories with far less empirical support.
Attachment theory may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowl by himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners.
Based on findings that foster children's attachments are disproportionately likely to be disorganized and foster mothers with an unresolved or dismissing state of mind were likely to have children with disorganized attachments.
Caregiver and child behaviors are assessed before and after intervention, as is the child regulation of neuroendocrine function.
Caregivers learn, understand and then practice observational and inferential skills regarding their children's attachment behaviors and their own caregiving responses.
Children experiencing frightening conditions have a limited range of responses and often 'dissociate' as a way of coping.
Circle of Security is being field tested within the 'Head Start'/'Early Head Start' programme in the USA.
During the therapy sessions the parent expresses his or her thoughts and feelings which are based on a combination of factors including.
Five sessions per week are a combination of talk and play.
For these reasons, readers should take special care to consider definitions of terms in this article.
Foster cares tend to respond 'in kind' to infants behavior.
Foster children often show an atypical production of the stress hormone cortisol.
Half the infants are assigned to the Developmental Education for Families programme as a comparison intervention.
Here it is important that the child goes through their own feelings and recognize them forming them into mental representations.
Here the main goal is to direct and focus the attention of the child to the inner world (feelings, thoughts, wishes and impulses).
If children are at a very young age an adapted psychoanalytic technique maybe necessary.
If foster infants behave in an avoidant or resistant manner, foster cares may act as if the infant does not need them.
If the normal course of secure attachment between parent and infant is disrupted, parent-infant psychotherapy is one technique that can be used to restore this bond.
In affect regulation the often diffuse affects of the child within the therapeutic relation are explored.
In some cases parent-infant psychotherapy is a possibility.
Infants in foster care are often dysregulated at physiological, behavioral and emotional levels.
Infants in foster care often experience threatening conditions.
Infants in foster care often fail to elicit nurturance.
Intervention programme aims to provide specialized help for foster carers in recognition of the fact that a young child placed in foster care has to deal with the loss of attachment figures at a time when maintaining contact with attachment figures is vital.
Intervention programme is essentially a training programme for surrogate caregivers.
Intervention programme targets key issues: providing nurturance for infants when the carers are not comfortable providing nurturance, overriding tendencies to respond in kind to infant behaviors and providing a predictable interpersonal environment.
Interventions are based on improving thinking about mental conditions and mental processes.
It is not established whether this is significant for increased risk for later disorders, but very low or very high levels are associated with types of psychopathology in adults.
It is reported that preliminary results of data analysis of 75 dyads suggest a significant shift from disordered to ordered patterns, and increases in classifications of secure attachment.
It is stated that it is explicitly based on contemporary attachment and congruent developmental theories.
MBKT addresses problems with an infant’s ability to distinguish reality and fantasy.
MBKT can be qualified as an intensive form of therapy with two to five sessions per week.
MBKT helps lower the risk for psychopathological developments of the child in the future.
MBKT technique helps the parent to resolve issues with his or her own infancy-experiences in order to restore secure attachment with the infant.
Mental health interventions for children vary with respect to the problem being addressed and to the age and other individual characteristics of the child.
Mentaliseren Bevorderende Kinder Therapie is translated as “therapy for children enhancing their ability to mentalise”.
Mentalization is a conscious as well as an unconscious process which enables people to see that actions and thoughts of themselves and others are motivated by internal thoughts, intentions and attitudes.
Mentalizing is accomplished when two developmental concepts can be integrated.
One of the functions of parents is to protect children from real or perceived dangers.
Other components which are crucial in the development of the child and also mainly dependent on the quality of the attachment to the parent are “attention regulation” and “affect regulation”.
Parent-Infant Psychotherapy addresses problems with normal relationships between parent and child.
Possible evidence for this may be the disproportionate number of disorganized attachment patterns in foster children.
Prime examples are threats contingent upon behavior to have the child removed or taken away.
Providing nurturance when it does not come naturally.
Sessions are videotaped for feedback and for fidelity.
Specifically, the equivalent modus and the pretend modus.
Terms describing child treatments may vary from one part of the world to another, with particular differences in the use of the terms "psychotherapy" and "psychoanalysis".
The ability to mentalise is the capability of seeing one’s self or other people’s behaviour in terms of assumed mental conditions.
The aim is to reduce threatening behavior among foster parents by helping them understand the impact on the child.
The aim of the protocol is to present these ideas to the parents in a ‘userfriendly’, common-sense fashion that they can understand both cognitively and emotionally.
The child isn’t aware of the reality level when he’s pretending.
The childs attachment pattern is classified using either Ainsworth or the PAC (Preschool Attachment Classification System).
The developers themselves point out that they do not test for caregiver commitment although they state this may or may not be a critical omission as they consider caregiver commitment to be a crucial variable in terms of child outcomes.
The goal here is to help foster parents follow the child lead and become more responsive social partners.
The goal is to help foster parents provide nurturing care even if they are non-autonomous with regard to their own attachment status.
The goal is to train foster carers to act in a nurturing manner even in the absence of cues from the infant.
The interpretation of Dozier et al is that foster children have difficulty organizing their attachment systems unless they have nurturing foster cares.
The intervention consists of 10 sessions administered in care givers homes by professional social workers.
The intervention is currently being assessed in a randomized clinical trial involving 200 foster families, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health.
The Nederlands Psychoanalytisch Instituut NPI (Dutch Psychoanalytic Institute) has been working with a form of therapy for children called “Mentaliseren Bevorderende Kinder Therapie” (MBKT) since 2003.
The parent’s expectations and hopes for the child’s future.
The program is designed to address the developmental and health needs of children under the age of 5 who have been maltreated and placed in foster care.
The program is funded by the state government of Louisiana and private funds.
The programme, which takes place weekly over 20 weeks, consists of group sessions, video feedback vignettes and psycho-educational and therapeutic discussions.
The protocol has so far been aimed at and tested on preschoolers up to the age of 4 years.
The starting point in “attention regulation” is that the child is still functioning from the “equivalent modus” which means there are insufficient affect representations.
The therapist will play and talk with the child in order to make contact with the inner world of the child and thus shape all the bits and pieces that needs to be integrated.
The therapist’s role is as an observer and an interpreter of the interaction between the infant and the parent.
The therapy is then 'individualized' according to each dyads attachment/caregiver pattern.
Therapist might share some of his thoughts about the behaviour of the child with the parent and by doing so offering the parent an alternative way of experiencing the child.
There are several different techniques to approach the psychoanalytic treatment of children.
There is an initial assessment which utilises the 'Strange Situation' procedure, (Ainsworth 1978), observations, a videotaped interview using the Parent Development Interview (Aber et al 1989) and the Adult Attachment Interview (George et al 1984) and caregiver questionnaires regarding the child.
This an intervention programme aimed at infants who have experienced early adverse care and disruptions in care.
This article covers all types of therapies aimed at children from behavioural, psychodynamic or other fields.
This has often broken down for foster children, and worse, the caregiver may have served as a threat themselves.
This incapability to integrate those feelings may influence the modus in which the child comes to operate.
This is a foster care intervention devised by J.A.Larrieu and C.H Zeanah in 1998.
This is a parent education and psychotherapy intervention developed by Marvin et al (2002) designed to shift problematic or 'at risk' patterns of attachment – caregiving interactions to a more appropriate developmental pathway.
This is done by a graphic representation of the child’s needs and attachment system in circle form, summarizing the child’s needs and the safe haven provided by the caregiver.
This latter point aims to address the miscuing defensive strategies of the caregiver.
This technique requires a three-way relationship between the parent, child and therapist.
This therapy is partly based on the theory of Fonagy [3] (2002) in which mentalization is the central theme.
To increase the caregivers sensitivity and appropriate responsiveness to the child’s signals relevant to its moving away from to explore, and its moving back for comfort and soothing.
To increase their ability to reflect on their own and the child’s behavior, thoughts and feelings regarding their attachment – caregiving interactions.
To reflect on experiences in their own histories that affects their current caregiving patterns.
Traumata can cause the child to refrain from very painful feelings connected to the events and or persons connected to the trauma.
Two techniques will be discussed: Parent-Infant Psychotherapy and Mentaliseren Bevorderende Kinder Therapie (MBKT).
When both modus are integrated the child is aware that he’s pretending and then we speak of mentalization.
When the regulation of either is not sufficient a therapy may help to influence the flow of both.
With a child that only functions in the pretend modus there’s a difference between reality and fantasy however they exist separately from each other.
With “the ability to mentalise” concept different types of mental processes play a role.
'"Manipulation of sensitive responsiveness", van den Boom (1994) This intervention focused on low socio-economic group mothers with irritable infants, assessed on a behavioural scale.
'"Modified Interaction Guidance" Benoit et al (2001)' This intervention aimed to reduce inappropriate caregiver behaviours as measured on the AMBIANCE (atypical maternal behaviour instrument for assessment and classification).
A population mean volume of 650 ml would be considered low. As with bodyweight, it is apparent that considerable metabolic adaptation protects milk supply against the worst effects of dietary deficiency.
A reduced level of activity in children consuming inadequate but not disastrously low amounts of dietary energy has also been reported among rural children living in Uganda.
A significant decrease in inappropriate maternal behaviours and disrupted communication was found in the MIG group.
Acceleration of growth was confirmed and clinical examination of the children and reports from teachers suggested that the milk-fed children had improved in general condition and became much more alert and more boisterous and difficult to control than others.
Access to reflective supervision is needed to prevent a sense of helplessness and a "self-protective tendency to view complex clinical cases as intractable".
Activity is an even more relevant functional parameter for pregnant and lactating women, as they represent an important component of the labouring work-force, particularly in rural areas of the developing world.
All maternal components improved. Further, a 'strange situation' assessment carried out at 12 months showed only 38% classified as insecure compared to 78% in the control group.
All the types of indicators discussed can be useful as long as their limitations are appreciated.
Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother.
An example of the latter use is a large-scale integrated rural development programme currently being funded by the British government in Nepal.
An important measurement is the baby's milk intake, although there is a wide normal range, and at an individual level only values below 500 ml/24 hr between one and five months of age can definitely be considered inadequate.
As discussed in section 1.17, studies in Sri Lanka have demonstrated that iron supplementation enables work output to be increased.
As of 2005, 250 children had participated in the programme.
Assessment measures used were the Ainsworth sensitivity rating, Ainsworth et al (1974).
Assessment of maternal nutritional status during lactation is more difficult.
Attachment security involved 29 studies and 1,503 participants.
Babies' birth-weight, height, and head circumference relative to gestational age at birth are crucial parameters.
Birth-weights in poor economic circumstances in the developing world are much lower than in Europe and North America
Changes in parental sensitivity are causally related to attachment security.
Children entering psychotherapy have most often been exposed to family violence or other traumatic experiences.
Cohen et al (1999)' This intervention involved mothers and infants referred for a community health service.
Developmental delays in the children are common and there is a considerable range of regulatory, socioemotional and developmental problems.
Early intervention on parental sensitivity and infant attachment security is effective.
Especially 'miscues' as the signals of such children are often confusing as a consequence of their often frightening, inconsistent and confusing past relationships.
For example, protein deficiency may compound the fall in albumin concentration that normally accompanies pregnancy because of haemodilution.
For half the session the mother gets down on the floor with the infant, observes it and interacts only on the infant initiative.
For lactating women it is likely that assessments of overall health and well-being plus her capacity for an active life are likely to be the most revealing.
For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.
Foster care are also formally assessed using a structured clinical interview which includes in particular the meaning of the child to the foster parent..
Foster cares are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.
Foster cares are taught to recognize what such children actually need rather than what they may appear to signal that they need.
Foster parents may also present barriers to forming healthy attachment relationships. Based on Bowlby, the care giving system is seen as a bio behavioral system in adults that is complementary to the child attachment system.
Further, despite harsh and inconsistent treatment many of the children remain attached to their parents, complicating the development of new attachment relationships.
In Guatemala, by contrast, the corresponding figure was only about 25 per cent.
In Nepal there are inputs from agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, irrigation, and education as well a health.
In research programmes, placental weight is also an important measurement.
In the Gambia the unanimous first reason given by pregnant and lactating mothers for the popularity of the biscuit supplement was that it gave them more "power" for work.
In the interpretation of mortality data it is obviously important to take into account the cause of death.
Individualised interventions for each child are devised based on age, clinical presentation and information on the child/foster care match.
Infants in the watch, wait and wonder group were significantly more likely to shift to a secure or organised attachment classification than infants in the psychodynamic psychotherapy group.
Intervention programmes are always and universally effective.
Intervention was based on Ainsworth's sensitive responsiveness components, namely perceiving a signal, interpreting it correctly, selecting an appropriate response and implementing the response effectively.
Interventions include supporting foster parents to learn to help the child in regulating emotions, to learn to respond effectively to the child distress and to understand the child signals.
Investigations into work capacity and energy output need to be designed with imagination and flexibility.
It has been pointed out however that specific care giver response to attachment (the precursors to secure attachments) were not measured.
It is based on the notion of the infant as initiator in infant-parent psychotherapy.
It is not unreasonable to suggest that the latter style of working provides a greater sense of well-being and general happiness.
It is possible for a woman to complete the same task with a minimum of extraneous effort or with more joie de vivre.
It is quite apparent that the use of functional tests is a subject that merits a much greater research input.
It was found that these infants scored significantly higher than the control infants on sociability, self soothing and reduced crying.
It will be necessary to establish an appropriate methodology in which data will be collected on a continuing basis.
Not all foster cares have this strong biological disposition as many fear becoming too 'attached' and suffering loss, many are effectively doing it to earn money and some perceive such children as 'damaged goods' and may remain emotionally distant and under involved.
Of equal importance, whose results will be analysed and made available quickly so that necessary changes in the overall programme can be made when necessary.
Outcome data published in 2001 revealed a 68% reduction in maltreatment recidivism for the same child returning to its parent(s) and a 75% reduction in recidivism for a subsequent child of the same mother.
Plasma amino-acid patterns can also be informative, but this is a subject for research.
Presenting problems included feeding, sleeping, behavioural regulation, maternal depression and feelings of failure in bonding or attachment.
Psychiatric and substance abuse histories and other criminal activities are common.
Quite apart from their intrinsic physiological interest, it would enable the merits of nutritional intervention programmes to be translated into terms relevant to national development planning.
Sensitivity findings were based on 81 studies involving 7,636 families.
Serious relationship disturbances are considered likely to be important contributors to difficulties in establishing new attachment relationships.
Since there is, as yet, no evidence that they were doing more actual work, it can only be concluded that this statement means the mothers were better able to work well within their capacity rather than at the extreme limit.
Soon after coming into care the children are intensively assessed, in foster care, and then receive multi modal treatments.
Studies at INCAP in Guatemala have likewise demonstrated that energy intake of pre-school children can be reduced from 90 to 80 kcal/kg without affecting nitrogen balance or growth.
Such children often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers.
Such inappropriate behaviours are thought to contribute to disorganized attachment.
Such measurements could not be recommended for public health programmes at the present time.
The aim of the foster care intervention is to support the building of an attachment relationship between the children and foster cares, even though about half of the children eventually return to their parents after about 12 to 18 months.
The aim was to develop a programme for designing foster care as an intervention.
The assessment 'team' remains involved in delivering the intervention.
The authors claim the programme not only assists the building of new attachments to foster parents but also has the potential impact a families development long after a returned child is no longer in care.
The biochemical measurements listed in the previous paragraph can be of even greater importance during pregnancy.
The child may perceive relationships as inconsistent and undependable.
The concept of using nutritional status indicators for this purpose has been accepted enthusiastically.
The conclusion was that "Interventions with an exclusively behavioural focus on maternal sensitivity appear to be most effective not only in enhancing maternal sensitivity but also in promoting children's attachment security."
The designers note Mary Doziers program to foster the development of relationships between children and foster cares (ABC) and her work showing the connection between foster children's symptomology and foster cares attachment status.
The difference in height growth between supplemented and unsupplemented children in this trial was 6 mm/year, but the difference in activity was likely to have been of much greater importance.
The disturbed nature of the child relationship with its parent(s) before their removal by the state.
The idea is that it increases the mother sensitivity and responsiveness by fostering an observational reflective stance, whilst also being physically accessible.
The play focused intervention (MIG) was compared with a behaviour modification intervention focused on feeding.
The proportion of children born with a weight below 2.5 kg is a particularly relevant statistic because neonatal and infant mortality rise sharply below this point.
The randomly assigned control group undertook psychodynamic psychotherapy.
The randomly assigned group received 3 treatment sessions, between the ages of 6 and 9 months, based on maternal responsiveness to negative and positive infant cues.
The selection criteria were very broad, intending to include as many intervention studies as possible.
There is a conscious effort to build on recent, although limited, research into the incidence and causes of Reactive attachment disorder and risk factors for RAD and other psychopathologies.
There is one final type of measurement of great potential value: measurement of functional capacity, an obvious example being the level of physical activity.
They can be used for the obvious direct purpose of assessing the effect of interventions on nutrition and health, but also as indirect indicators of social development.
They might be taken more seriously by politicians and government officials than would more medical and biochemical measurements whose significance is less obvious.
This cannot be solely attributable to dietary deficiency since infections like malaria can profoundly affect birth-weigh.
This was an attempt to collect and synthesise the data to try to come to "evidence based" conclusions on the best intervention practices for attachment in infants.
Thomson(15), describing trials organized in the United Kingdom by Boyd Orr and others in the 1920s to test the effect of giving milk to school-children.
Those running the programme maintain regular phone and visit contact and there are support groups for foster parents.
Three studies were singled out by Prior and Glaser to illustrate intervention processes which have shown good results.
To maintain this enthusiasm, however, and to provide the governments of both nations with meaningful information.
Treating traumatized children may be unusually challenging for the therapist because of vicarious traumatization.
Type and timing of Intervention programme makes a difference.
Weight is normally lost during lactation at a rate of 570 g/month (14), but, as described in section 3.2, considerable metabolic adaptations occur and excessive weight loss is not observed unless food intake is exceptionally low.
Withdrawn children may be overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate children may be considered to be managing much better than they are.
Work is based on findings that the qualitative features of foster parent narrative descriptions of the child and relationship with the child have been strongly associated with the foster parents.
31% of children under the age of 5 in the developing world are moderately (height-for-age is below minus 2 standard deviations) or severely stunted (below minus 3 standard deviations).
A direct policy focus on determinants of childhood cognitive ability has been urged.
A group of largely African American urban first-grade children and their caregivers were evaluated using self-report, interview, and standardized tests, including IQ tests.
A joint statement on vitamin and mineral deficiencies says that the severity of such deficiencies "means the impairment of hundreds of millions of growing minds and the lowering of national IQs."
A Lancet review identified 201 chemicals with the ability to cause clinical neurotoxic effects in human adults, as described in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.
A later related very long term study looked at the effect of giving 6-24 months old children in Guatemala a high protein-energy drink as a dietary supplement.
A major portion skin whitening products, especially popular sold in stores around Asia, have been criticized by many, such as the FDA, for the presence of these toxic chemicals.
A recent theory suggests that early childhood stress may affect the developing brain and cause negative effects.
A significantly positive and fairly substantial effects was found on increasing the probability of attending school and of passing the first grade, increasing the grade attained by age 13, increasing completed schooling attainment, and for adults aged 25-40 increasing IQ test scores.

Additional vitamin-mineral supplementation may have an effect also in the developed world.
Adjusting for maternal cognitive ability as measured by IQ and education eliminated the association between lower IQ and tobacco smoking.
Although some observers have argued that the first six months of life are the most critical in the sense that malnutrition during that time period harms cognitive development more than malnutrition later in life
Although these prevention campaigns are highly successful, most were initiated only after substantial delays.
An appendix listed furher industrial chemicals considered to be neurotoxic.
Another study found a positive effect of breastfeeding also after controlling for parental IQ.

Fish oil supplement to pregnant and lactating mothers has been linked to increased cognitive ability in one study.
For example, acute undernutrition for a few months during the Dutch famine of 1944 caused a decrease in mean birthweight in certain areas.
For example, the Copenhagen consensus, states that lack of both iodine and iron has been implicated in impaired brain development, and this can affect enormous numbers of people.
Fortification of staple foods (cereals, flour, sugar, salt) to deliver micronutrients to children on a large scale is probably the most sustainable and affordable option, even though commitment from governments and the food industry is needed.
Giving a nutritional supplementation (1 kg milk based formula each week) to these already stunted children had no significant effect on later scores, but psychosocial stimulation (weekly play sessions with mother and child) had a positive effect.
Health and intelligence are two closely-related aspects of human well-being.
Healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth, access to which is often governed by policy, also influences cognitive development.
his was not later associated with a change in performance on IQ tests for 18-19 years old Dutch males draftees from these areas compared to control areas.
However, a majority of products sold there are cited by Hong Kong officials to contain mercury as its active ingredient, often a whopping 27,000 to 60,000 times the "acceptable" dose.
However, a recent study finds that maternal tobacco smoking has no direct causal effect on the child's IQ.

However, this is costly, distribution mechanisms are often ineffective, and compliance is low.
In developing countries, it is estimated that 40% of children aged four and under suffer from anaemia because of insufficient iron in their diets.
In order to prevent iron deficiency an option is giving specific supplementation, for example as tablets.
Instead, it was the mother's IQ that had a significant correlation with the IQ of her offspring, whether the offspring was breastfed or was not breastfed.
It is estimated that 2 billion people (one-third of the total global population) are affected by iodine deficiency, including 285 million 6- to 12-year-old children.
It may also happen due to deficiencies of different nutrients, such as micronutrients, protein or energy.
Malnutrition may occur during several different periods of growth, such as pregnancy, during breastfeeding, infancy, or childhood.
Many additional chemicals have been shown to be neurotoxic in laboratory models.
Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy is associated with increased activity, decreased attention, and diminished intellectual abilities.
Micronutrient deficiencies (e.g. in iodine and iron) influence the development of intelligence and remain a problem in the developing world.
More speculatively, other nutrients may prove important in the future.
Most of this can explain by the very large increase for a subgroup of the children, presumably because these were not adequately nourished unlike the majority.
Neighborhood risk has been related to lower school grades for African-American adolescents in another study from 2006.
On the disease front, malaria affects 300–500 million persons each year, mostly children under age five in Africa.
One study from developing country, Guatemala, found that poor growth during infancy, rather than low birth weight, was negatively related to adolescent performance on cognitive and achievement tests.
Overall, studies investigating whether cognitive function in already iron-deficient children can be improved with iron supplements have produced mixed results, possible because deficiency in critical growth periods may cause irreversible damage.
Policies to manage lead differ between nations, particularly between the developed and developing world.
Policy recommendations to increase availability of micronutrient supplements have been made and justified in part by the potential to counteract intelligence-related developmental problems.
Preventable causes of low intelligence in children include infectious diseases such as meningitis, parasites, and cerebral malaria, prenatal drug and alcohol exposure, newborn asphyxia, low birth weight, head injuries, and endocrine disorders.
Recognition of these risks has led to evidence-based programmes of prevention, such as elimination of lead additives in petrol.
Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood-brain barrier is less effective.
Several studies from developed nations have found that with the exception of extreme intrauterine growth retardation also affecting brain growth, and hypoxic injury, IUGR seems to have little or no measurable effect on mental performance and behavior in adolescence or adulthood.
Several studies with better design have shown substantial benefits.
Since mother's IQ was predictive of whether a child was breastfed, the study concluded that "breast feeding [itself] has little or no effect on intelligence in children."
Since SES correlates with IQ, this may have hidden an effect caused by the undernutrition.
Skin whitening products, which a majority sold in Asian nations contain mercury or hydroquinone, are also very harmful to the brain development of fetuses in pregnant women.
Skin whitening products; often contain toxic chemicals, such as mercury and hydroquinone, as the active ingredient.

The impact of health on intelligence is one of the most important factors in understanding human group differences in IQ test scores and other measures of cognitive ability.
The longstanding belief that breastfeeding correlates with an increase in the IQ of offspring was challenged in a 2006 paper published in the British Medical Journal.
The prevalence was even higher previously since the worldwide prevalence of stunting is declining by about half of a percentage point each year.
The results indicated that mother's IQ, not breastfeeding, explained the differences in the IQ scores of offspring.
The results of this study argued that prior studies had not allowed for the mother's IQ.
The study controlled for sex, race, region, poverty, parent education and marital status, ferritin, and blood lead concentration.
The study reported that exposure to violence and trauma-related distresses in young children were associated with substantial decrements in IQ and reading achievement.
The study suggests that parents of schoolchildren whose academic performance is substandard would be well advised to seek a nutritionally oriented physician for assessment of their children's nutritional status as a possible etiology.
The subjects were exposed to famine prenatally but not after birth. During the famine, births decreased more among those with lower SES, whereas after the famine, there was a compensatory increase in births among those with lower SES.
The use of skin whitening products is especially popular in Hong Kong.
The use of some skin whitening products, unusually popular amongst Asian women, has detrimental effects toward IQ.
These include laws requiring fortification of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants (e.g. lead, mercury, and organochlorides).
They were less likely to have children with low verbal IQ, motor coordination and behavioral problems.
Those with the "G" version have no IQ advantage.
Two studies in Chile on 18 years old high-school graduates found that nutritional status during the first year of life affected IQ, scholastic achievement, and brain volume.

Supplement energy foods with nutrient dense foods.
That risk was 2.5 to 2.3 times higher than babies born at term.
The aim of good prenatal care is to detect any potential problems early, to prevent them if possible (through recommendations on adequate nutrition, exercise, vitamin intake etc), and to direct the woman to appropriate specialists, hospitals, etc. if necessary.

Factors related to the previous birth are bakthi, good conduct, memory, cleanliness, charity, courage, feebleness, wealth, wavering mind and jealously.
Features development from the aatma are birth in a specific species, knowledge about oneself, manas, respiration, retention and ejaculation of respiration and flatus, appearence, voice, specific complexion, happiness, sorrow, longing and hatred.
Focused attention to reducing the incidence of anaemia.
For three days after the appearance of the menses the young wife should avoid cohabitation, should sleep on a grass mat (made of kusha grass), eat mild food like plain rice, from small earthen vessels.
Growth of community based institutions that will initiate and take responsibility for healthcare and other development needs of the community.
Hence for baby to be born with all the good qualities it is essential that all these factors viz., the mother, father, rasa (the product of digestion of the mother’s food) the aatma etc. Should be in good state.
Hence, to have a healthy child the contributing factors viz. shukra and aarthava, should be in their normal healthy state.
His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales visited Kutail Gamri village, one of the 35 villages adopted by Pfizer for the Mother and Child Primary HealthCare Community based program in rural Haryana.
However, it is equally possible that ISMs themselves can benefit by systematically observing various local practices - some of these cannot be readily comprehended in the light of the theory of ISMs.
Immunisations now cover over 98% of the children in these target villages.
Impoverished villagers are trained for healthcare and rural development activities as health workers, midwives, motivators and community organisers.
In 1986 the Lok Swaasthya Parampara Samvardhan Samithi (LSPSS) had decided to hold a convention on the theme of - "Mother and Child Health in Traditional Medicine".
In 1989 December a National Convention was organised on the theme of "Mother and Child Health in Traditional Systems of Medicine".
In November/December 2001, Pfizer India had supported a survey, which was conducted by the Voluntary Health Association of India, (VHAI) in the 35 identified villages.
In this convention presentations were made regarding various themes relating to the subjects from the view point of Aayurveda and independently from the viewpoint of modern medicine.
It is advised that the man and woman should be of different gothras or clans and only then the child born to them would be healthy and strong.
It is most important that the man and wife are both in a good mental state i.e. with feelings like - anger, fright, jealousy or hatred.
It is of course obvious that the interaction between the Lok Swaasthya Paramparaas and the ISMS has to be in the nature of a dialogue.
Local practices that were recorded during the LSPSS Survey as well as other surveys in the literature have been commented upon.
LSPSS was decided that a detailed survey would be undertaken to elicit information regarding various traditional practices in the area of Mother and Child Health.
Measurable results at the end of a 3-year period will show improvements in infant and maternal mortality.
Mobile Health Teams provides treatment of common diseases and a village level referral centre, and also technical backup for the primary level team of village based health workers.
Most of these studies have been done by practitioners of modern systems of medicine, with training in fields like Nutrition, Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics and Community Health.
On the fourth day she should have abhyanga snaanam (head-bath after applying oil) and water apparel.
On the one hand the input from ISMS can help us to make an assessment and evaluation of the Lok Swaasthya Parmaparaas - this would help to strengthen these traditions by confirming what sound is, complete what is incomplete and to identify any distortions.
One such example is the study of traditional child rearing practices of Nepal.
Parenting can be complicated and is frequently a difficult job.
Pfizer has adopted 35 villages in rural Haryana for a Primary Healthcare Program.
Pfizer has been supporting the Arpana Research and Charities Trust, in rural Haryana, since June 2002, for a three-year term, with the objective of conducting an effective Mother and Child Primary Health Care initiative to reduce anaemia in pregnant women and adolescent girls.
Pneumonia and other chest conditions; diarrhoea with extreme dehydration; and renal and other stones endemic in the area.
Prevent the growing incidence and burden of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.
Primary Healthcare Program also promotes community health covering diarrhoea management, antenatal care, child nutrition, immunisation etc.
Primary Healthcare Program provides services for women and girls (including reproductive health care and care of adolescent girls) and child care services.
Primary Level - Village Health Workers: Community based preventive health services, implemented by closely knit teams of primary level community workers from villages, including the traditional midwife.
Prince Charles visits Pfizer’s Community Health Care Project in Haryana during his recent visit to India in October 2003.
Prince Charles, walked through the streets of the village, visited several houses and interacted with a number of people, including women and children.
Reduction in child and maternal mortality is a target of the programme.
Secondary Level - Mobile Health Teams: Mobile clinics, linked to the referral base, visit all the project villages monthly to deliver a wide range of health care services for mother and child, including immunisation, and family planning components.
She should not pare her nails, should not wipe or apply collyrium.
Smaller families that would ensure better living standards.
Some of the mental faculties are also derived from the previous birth (poorva jenma vaasana).
Some of the qualities of a person are derived from saathmya, satwa and rajas.
Studies that have evaluated these practices from the perspective of Indigenous Systems of Medicine (ISM) are quite rare.
Substantial immunisation coverage; growth monitoring of children; and identification and management of infectious diseases, diarrhoea, childhood pneumonia, etc.
Such practices need to be studied further and understood.
Tertiary Level - Referral to the 170-bed Arpana Hospital: Patients and pregnant women are referred to the hospital by midwives and health workers who are based at the target villages.
The Arpana Research and Charities Trust was founded in 1980, specifically for promoting health and rural development.
The Arpana Research and Charities Trust’s uniqueness is its composition of approximately 70 people of diverse nationalities and religions who have pledged themselves to a singular purpose – Rural health care.
They differ emotionally and in their temperament based on their place in the family, their biology, as well as the culture and the experiences in which they are raised.
The factors contributed by saatmya are freedom from diseases, absence of idleness, absence of greed, normal voice, normal complexion, normal seed, constant happiness, brain, perspicuity of indriyas, high quality of ojas, longevity, strength and energy.
The first twelve nights after the cessation of the menstrual flow are considered to be the proper (best) period for conception.
The following are some of the key findings, with the improvements achieved by the end of the second year and the targets for the third year, i.e., 2004.
The incidence of low birth weight in infants is 35 to 45%.
The infant mortality rate is 90 per 1000 live births.
The information that was thus gathered was analysed and evaluated from the view point of Aayurveda.
The marriageable age of the man and woman have also been specified as twenty years and sixteen years respectively for getting healthy progeny.
The parts derived from the father are hair (scalp), beard, moustache, body hair, teeth, bones, veins, tendons, arteries, semen and nails.
The Prasnopanishad states that "Praanam vaa ethy praskadanthi ye diva rathya sanyujanthe; brahmacharymeva tadyadrathrau rathya sanjujyanthe" i.e. "Those who cohabit with their wives in the daytime lose their vitality and those who restrict this to the night time remain brahmachaaris".
The prince also met the village's 20 midwives and saw how the Arpana Trust was working with locals to educate them in skills such as midwifery.
The program targets the reduction of anaemia in pregnant women, adolescent girls, and those with diseases linked to anaemia.
The project covers 35 villages in and around Karnal district, Haryana, and a population of approximately 60,000 persons.
The purpose of this monograph is to present in a summarised form the traditional approach to - "Garbhini Charya”: the care of pregnant woman.
The qualities derived from the mother are: skin, blood, muscles, fat, umbilicus, hrudaya, pancreas, liver, spleen, kidney, urinary bladder and bone marrow.
The rasajabhaavas are the origin of body or manifestation of different body parts, growth of body, attachment of life or strength with body, contentment nourishment, enthusiasm or zeal, energy or strength, health, unhealthy state, complexion, maintenance of body and greedlessness.
The sources of these mahaabhoothas are said to be the mother, father, rasa and aatma.
The subject of mother and child health begins very much earlier than the time of conception.
The subject of Mother and Child Health is a very important one on which there is widespread traditional knowledge in the community.
The training of dais is now an essential part of the maternal and child health programme not only in India but also in over fifty other countries.
Thereafter the garbha is formed with all the gyaanendriyaas and karmendriyaas (sensory and motor organs) and endowed with the excellence of strength, complexion and mental faculties, by the time of delivery.
These workers help change practices in health, gender equality, environmental sanitation, mother and childcare, care of the handicapped, mobilisation of women, and increasing people's accessibility to education, employment, and income generation.
This garbha is nourished by the wholesome rasa (final product of digestion of the mother’s food) and maintained by proper regimen (of the mother).
This is also special in as much as it is here that Government has (however grudgingly) taken note of existence of Local Health Practitioners namely dais.
This is so, because the quality of the aarthava (the secretion of the female genital organs) and that of the shukra (the semen) are reflected in the product of conception.
This is unique in the sense that this perhaps is the area where the largest body of specialised traditional health practitioners exist namely dais.
To maintain a healthy womb and normal aarthava one should observe certain regimen during the rithu kaala (during menstruation or menstrual periods).
We can find examples in epics like Mahabharatha about instances where the mother either due to aversion or due to fright is not in a balanced state of mind, resulting in the birth of defective children like Drutharashtra (who was born blind) and Paandu (who was born weak and defective).
We hope that such an interaction will also infuse more dynamism into our ISMs and update their practice.
When the shukra (of a healthy man) comes into contact with the aarthava (of a healthy lady with unaffected garbhaashaya), during the fertile period, then the jeeva (soul) along with the mind descends into it to form the garbha.
While describing the contra indications of coitus Bhaavamisra includes cohabitation with a woman of the same gothra.
While enumerating the restrictions on who can be a marriage partner, the Dharmashaasthras also specify - "Asapindaa cha yaa mathurasagothra cha ya pithuh" i.e. "(One can marry a person who is not a sapinda to one's mother and not of the same gothra as one's father").

At Memorial’s Children’s Therapy Center, your children are our first priority.
Babies can calm and control extra movements and find support by bracing their feet against soft rolls, infant clothing or caregiver’s hands.
Babies cry for many reasons – even preemies express hunger, need for a diaper change and need for holding with fussing and crying.
Babies use cycling of attention or withdrawing to sleep or just closing their eyes from time to time during interaction as a way to rest.
Babies who are comfortable have a look of calm restfulness and they have pink skin tones.
Being familiar with general cues and then recognizing and responding to your baby’s special communications will help you care for your baby in NICU and when you go home.

A child's temperament and maternal depressive symptoms were found to be similar to the use of and quality of child care in terms of their strength in predicting mother-child interactions.
A designated parent is selected in households where both parents are present to report child care arrangements for each child.
According to the findings, children who regularly spend time in non-maternal care have "somewhat less positive" interactions with their mothers than children who spend less or no time in non-maternal care.
Age shifting occurs when a child’s birthday falls between the enrollment period for a child care program (i.e. school, Head Start, etc.) and the period that the SIPP survey takes place.
Although the setting of the care (home/center/relative's home) did not alter the results, the quality of the care did.
Although the study was not designed to be nationally representative, the average income of study families was similar to the average national household income.
APA's membership includes more than 159,000 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students.
Based on data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care, a longitudinal study of approximately 1,300 children.
Because of its large sample size, the NICHD study data allowed researchers to detect relatively small associations between child care and children.
Because the child care experience is not independent of children's family background, the researchers also studied the family influences on the quality of mother-child interaction.
Beginning with the 1996 SIPP panel, child care data was collected about all arrangements for all children under the age of 15, regardless of parental labor force status.
Both "maternal sensitivity" and "child engagement" describe behaviors that were observed and rated by the staff of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care.
Child care providers can be broadly classified as being relatives or non relatives of children.
Child engagement and positive mood during mother-child interaction were also rated.
Child engagement refers to how connected or involved a child appeared to be when relating to his or her mother.
Children participating in the study were placed in a variety of child care arrangements, ranging from the most informal (care with relatives) to the most formal (center care).
Confidence necessary to succeed in their present environment, and to deal with later responsibilities in school and in life.
Designated parents include biological, step- and adoptive parents, or other relatives/non-relatives acting as a guardian in the absence of parents.
Each child is treated as an individual in an inclusive community that values, respects, and responds to diversity.
Earlier SIPP panels only collected data on the primary and secondary child care arrangements for a limited number of children, and usually only for employed parents.
Enrollment in kindergarten/grade school and time spent in self-care are shown in the tables for informational purposes even though they are not considered to be child care arrangements.
Families and their children were recruited from 10 research sites across the United States.
For example, a five-year child enrolled in Head Start who turns six by the time of the survey would be out of universe for the Head Start question at interview date, resulting in an undercount of children in Head Start.
For example, when child care providers talk to children, encourage them to ask questions, respond to children's questions, read to them, challenge them to attend to others' feelings.
Further information about Head Start enrollment can be found at the Office of Head Start.
Head Start is a national program that promotes school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families.
Head Start offers parents opportunities and support for growth, so that they can identify their own strengths, needs and interests, and find their own solutions.
Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families.
Head Start serves families within the context of the community, and recognizes that many other agencies and groups work with the same families.
Head Start's commitment to wellness embraces a comprehensive vision of health for children, families, and staff.
higher quality care settings may provide mothers with positive role models for involved, sensitive interactions with their child
Higher quality child care was associated with increased maternal sensitivity.
If neither parent is in the household, the guardian is the designated parent.
If the mother is not available for an interview, proxy responses are accepted from the father or husband.
In a just-published analysis about mother-child interaction, the study showed that the number of hours infants and toddlers spent in child care was modestly linked to the sensitivity of the mother to her child, as well as to the engagement of the child with the mother in play.
In addition, the term multiple arrangements is used to designate children in more than one child care arrangement on a regular basis.
In addition, to put the issue of child care quality and stability into an appropriate context, the authors looked at other predictors of mother-child interactions.
In FY 1995, the Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to three years of age in recognition of the mounting evidence that the earliest years matter a great deal to children's growth and development.
In married-couple families, the mother is the designated parent.
In single-parent families, the resident parent is the designated parent.
In the just-published article the authors found that the results for child care hours and child care quality were not influenced by whether the child was in one form of child care or another.
Information collected on child care through SIPP has evolved over the years to include comprehensive data on child care use, cost, and receipt of government assistance.
It also includes family day care providers who are non-relatives who care for one or more unrelated children in the provider’s home.
Kindergarten/grade school is also included in the organized care total for children under 5 years.
Maternal sensitivity refers to how attuned a mother is to the child's wants and needs.
Moreover, the link between time spent in child care and mother-child interaction is equivalent to the link between maternal depression and maternal sensitivity.
Most of the earlier studies observed only a small number of children, measured the behavior of only one age group, and failed to include children with a very small number of hours in non maternal care.
Mother and child interactions were videotaped in 10-15 minutes sessions when the children were 6, 15, 24, and 36 months of age for almost a total of one hour for each of the nearly 1,300 children for whom the authors had complete information.
Mothers were rated in terms of their sensitivity to the child when the child was not distressed.
Non-relatives include in-home babysitters, neighbors, friends, and other non-relatives providing care either in the child's or the provider’s home.
Observers rated the degree of sensitivity of the mother, the degree of her intrusiveness, and the degree of positive regard or respect she showed toward the child.
On July 11, 2006, the Office of Head Start announced the launch of the Early Childhood Learning and Knowledge Center (ECLKC).
Organized care includes day care, nursery or preschool, and federal Head Start programs for those 5 years and younger.
Please take time to bookmark the site, visit it often and share with us your comments and suggestions.
Previous studies on whether the amount of time children spend in child care affected interactions with their mothers had conflicting results.
Relatives include mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, and other relatives such as aunts, uncles, and cousins.
Significant emphasis is placed on the involvement of parents in the administration of local Head Start programs.
Some parents may not be able to specify an arrangement that is used on a regular basis at least once a week and may reply as having no regular arrangement.
Such predictors of the quality of mother-child interaction include family income, maternal education, maternal depression, and mothers' marital status (or the status of having a partner).
The American Psychological Association (APA), in Washington, DC, is the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States and is the world's largest association of psychologists.
The authors looked at associations between the amount, quality and stability of child care and mother-child interactions when the children were 6, 15, 24 and 36 months old.
The authors point out that the findings of a small negative association between mother-child interaction and hours of care and a small positive association with quality of care may suggest that linkages with child care are more a product of mothers who use child care than a consequence of the care itself.
The building of trusting, collaborative relationships between parents and staff allows them to share with and to learn from one another.
The child care data presented in the detailed tables come from the fourth interview of the 2004 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panel conducted between February and May of 2005, and refer to child care arrangements used in the month prior to the interview.
The design and implementation of the SIPP child care module may lead to a certain amount of age shifting.
The ECLKC offers relevant, timely information, knowledge and learning to Head Start programs and the early childhood community in an easy-to-use format.
The ECLKC will grow and evolve over the next several years and is designed to be a comprehensive resource for anyone involved with or interested in early childhood education.
The findings appear in the November issue of Developmental Psychology.
The findings may also suggest that mothers who are more sensitive choose higher quality care for their children.
The findings may indicate that longer hours of child care are associated with some diminished familiarity and less ability of mother and child to be "in tune" with each other.
The findings may indicate that mothers who are less sensitive to their infants' signals or who have children who are less engaging use child care for more hours.
The greater maternal sensitivity is a function of the effect of the higher quality child care on the child's emerging verbal skills, behavior compliance and social competence.
The Head Start program provides grants to local public and private non-profit and for-profit agencies to provide comprehensive child development services to economically disadvantaged children and families.
The input of the Head Start community is critical to the future development of the ECLKC.
The investigators found a modest link between quality of child care and maternal sensitivity, meaning that the better the quality of child care the higher the level of maternal sensitivity.
The more hours a child spends during the first three years of life in non-maternal care the less positive the child's interactions with his/her mother.
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care has established that there is no consistent relation between the hours infants and toddlers spend in child care.
The NICHD Study of Early Child Care enrolled just over 1,300 children at birth at 10 research sites throughout the United States.
The objective of Child Health and Development Services is to ensure that, through collaboration among families, staff, and health professionals, all child health and developmental concerns are identified.
The objective of Community Partnerships is to ensure that grantee and delegate agencies collaborate with partners in their communities, in order to provide the highest level of services to children and families.
The objective of Education and Early Childhood Development is to provide all children with a safe, nurturing, engaging, enjoyable, and secure learning environment, in order to help them gain the awareness, skills.
The objective of Family Partnerships is to support parents as they identify and meet their own goals, nurture the development of their children in the context of their family and culture, and advocate for communities that are supportive of children and families of all cultures.
The percentage of ethnic minorities participating in the study was similar to the percentage of minorities in the nation as a whole.
The quality of the interaction between the mother and her child was assessed in terms of the mother's sensitivity to her child and in terms of the child's engagement with his or her mother during the joint play sessions.
The study is being conducted by investigators at the NICHD and at 14 universities around the country.
The universe of respondents in the SIPP child care module consists of adults who are the parents of children under 15 years old.
The varied experiences provided by the program support the continuum of children's growth and development, which includes the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development of each child.
They engage parents in their children's learning and help them in making progress toward their educational, literacy and employment goals.
This finding is similar to earlier findings from the same study, showing that higher quality of care is associated with more favorable consequences than lower quality of care.
This link between increased time a child spent in non maternal care and decreased quality of the mother-child interaction is smaller than the link between the higher level of the mother's education.
This link is sufficiently small so that it can be detected only under conditions in which other predictors of the quality of mother-child interaction are equivalent or are accounted for statistically.
Through its divisions in 50 subfields of psychology and affiliations with 58 state, territorial and Canadian provincial associations, APA works to advance psychology as a science, as a profession and as a means of promoting human welfare.
To different ways of thinking--children's language abilities and thinking skills are better than under conditions that are less enriched.
To foster the development of a continuum of family centered services, and to advocate for a community that shares responsibility for the healthy development of children and families of all cultures.
To present a comprehensive view of the regular weekly experiences of children under 15 years old, this report also shows the incidence of children enrolled in school and enrichment activities (such as sports, lessons, clubs, and after- and before-school care programs).
Twenty-four percent of the recruited families were members of an ethnic minority.
Variation in the number of hours in child care was related to both the mother's behavior toward her children and the children's positive engagement of the mother in their interactions.
We look forward to working with all of you to make this a resource that will change and improve the way we all do business.
When families are not similar in terms of these other predictors of the quality of mother-child interaction, the link between hours spent in child care and mother-child interaction can be difficult to detect.
With your assistance, we can make the ECLKC one of the most valuable tools available to the Early Childhood community.
6 children currently receiving vocational training: 2 tailoring, 2 car repairs, 1 electrical and 1 printing.
A nurse travels between villages, supporting the health workers and providing education and medical care.
Along with the industrial and commercial growth in the city, has come many problems, in particular the emergence of many new slums and the increase of street children.
Although the Government has promised to provide health services to each and every village of the state, but due to lack of proper communication systems many tribal villages are still inaccessible.
As well as providing a safe place for the children to stay and food for them to eat.
At the centre there is a tailoring course, where the boys can learn to make things such as bags and soft toys.
At the same time, the amount of slum areas, as well as the number of children living on the streets has also grown.
Bangalore City has grown to be one of the major industrial and commercial centres in India.
Childcare centres to provide general health care, as well as regular check ups at least every six months.
Children under 5 to take part in a nutritional supplement program to fight against malnutrition.
Developing a nutritional supplement program for all children under the age of five.
Disease and malnutrition are wide spread and every day children are dying of preventable and curable illnesses.
Funding a health clinic staffed by qualified nurses which services the villages.
Helping the health workers and village elders to develop a relationship with different government bodies.
Here most of our pregnant women are following the precautions except a few who can’t take rest during this period due to their family problems.
Holding health checkups every six months for all women and children.
In 2002, there were 40 children actually living at the centre full time, with the rest of the children coming to the centers on a daily basis.
In 2005 UCOA sent $26,383 to Bangalore to support this project.
It is estimated that there are approximately 45,000 street children in the city.
It is giving them an alternative to the poverty and destruction they are caught up in.
It was a rainy evening when Madhu of Nuaguda village, in the tribal Koraput district of Orissa, went into labour.
It was my first child and I was totally unaware of newborn care.
Kamala Khilo is one among six women of Nuaguda village who has received the Mother and Child Protection Care training organised by the ANKUR initiative of UNICEF.
Kamala Khilo, a Self Help Group member of the same village came to Madhu’s rescue and took her to the district hospital, about 70 kms from the village.
Kamala Khilo, who saved the life of Madhu and her child herself had been a victim of such ignorance.
Kamala silently waited for the doctor to come out of the Operation Theatre.
Madhu’s condition turned critical but her family was reluctant to take her to the hospital.
Maliguda is yet another village emulating the Nuaguda example.
Many government development initiatives have bypassed these tribal areas as they are so isolated and transport is always a major problem.
Many of the children earn money working as rag pickers, fruit vendors, boot polishers and pick pocketers.
Many of the children living on the streets are illiterate and have had little or no education.
Many of the street children in Bangalore have come to the city in search of employment and a new start.
Many of them are illiterate or have had very little education.
Melghat and Churni are two of the most isolated and disadvantaged areas in the state of Maharashtra.
Melghat and Churni, the two areas where the project is taking place, are located in the Satpura mountain ranges in the Amravati District of Maharashtra State.
More than 450 children have been helped to this project for children.
Most of our children were not immunized in those days. Now UNICEF and its training have opened our eyes.
Most of the children have already dropped out of school and if they do not want to return, the staff encourage them to learn other skills.
Most of them have no family network to rely on for support.
Now all four pregnant women have had their babies in the hospital and no woman wants to deliver at home anymore.
Otherwise all the 21 children in our village are immunized by now and four women out of six had institutional delivery.
Running the health centre and paying for staff, nutritional supplements for the children, training of village health workers.
She lost her first child because the untrained Dai cut the child’s umbilical cord just after his birth with a sharp piece of tile.
She was in an advanced stage of delivery and had developed complications that the untrained village Dai (traditional midwife) could not handle.
Since maternal mortality and infant mortality rates are pretty high in Koraput, this kind of initiative definitely helps in bringing about a change in the long term.
Social workers and other staff from the centre meet the children at designated spots throughout the city, such as train stations and markets.
Some needs of children of are food and clothing, blankets and bedding, resources for the training courses, counseling services.
Some of the villages in the region are completely inaccessible by road because of the mountainous conditions, and other villages are at times completely cut off from the outside world due to bad weather.
Still not convinced, Madhu’s husband was very annoyed and threatened Kamala that if anything should happen to Madhu or the child then he would kill her.
Suka Ram, Madhu’s husband apologized to Kamala and handed over his newborn son to her saying that the baby belonged to her as it was only because of her that the child and mother survived.
The Amravati District is about 200km west of Nagpur, the 2nd city of the state (Mumbai is the capital).
The Children in Crisis project is a project of the Church of South India (CSI), one of our partner churches in India.
The Children in Crisis project is an activity of the Uniting Church in Australia's partner church, the Church of South India .
The Children in Crisis project is focused around two main centres, both located in the middle of the city.
The Children in Crisis project is located in the middle of Bangalore City in the south of India.
The city itself has a population of 5.2 million people.
The doctor also thanked Kamala for bringing Madhu to the hospital in time, as otherwise, it would have been difficult to save her life.
The establishment of ten childcare centres in the villages.
The fourth day of training was about pre -school education, girls’ education, handling dropout children, water and sanitation.
The Karnataka Central Diocese, in which Bangalore is located, coordinates the project.
The main centre is called 'Makkala Ashraya Kendra' which means 'shelter of refuge for children who are in crisis'.
The Mother and Child care program is a program of the Church of North India, a partner church of the Uniting Church in Australia.
The Nagpur Diocese of the Church of North India is responsible for coordinating the Mother and Childcare project.
The objective of the project is to promote mother and child care in two of the most isolated and disadvantaged tribal areas in Nagpur – Melghat and Churni.
The people here are suffering and UCOA believes that we should support our partner, the Church of North India in their mission to build a society where each person, including the poor, the oppressed and the marginalised, have access to the basic necessities of life.
The project also encourages the children to return to school and gain an education, or to undertake vocational training programs to help them gain employment.
The project consists of a number of different sections - Training programs to teach mothers about basic nutrition and preventative health care.
The project is currently in its seventh year and in 2006, UCOA has made a commitment to provide $22,500 in financial support.
The project works with children living on the streets of Bangalore City.
The second centre was established in the second half of 2002, and is a day centre located in a hall that a local church has allowed the project to use.
The SHG members of Maliguda have also received the training and are implementing the regimen in their village.
The SHG members visit each and every household and motivate pregnant women to take care of themselves as well as make them aware of the immunization necessary for the children.
The staff try to build relationships with the children and encourage them to visit the centre.
The street children are easily drawn in to gangs and then become involved in violence and petty theft.
The street children in Bangalore have great needs for their life.
The train station was chosen as one of the meeting spots, as a way for staff to meet children that are arriving in Bangalore from other cities.
The tribal community needs to be aware of the fact that to some extent their ignorance about mother and childcare is also responsible for the high MMR and IMR in the district.
There are a number of ways that the project aims to improve and encourage mother and childcare in the tribal villages.
There are also other courses outside the centre, such as carpentry, driving and motor mechanics, that other boys attend.
There are currently 650 slums in Bangalore that are recognized by the Government.
These children are bored, they have no purpose in life and so they simply roam the streets looking for things to do.
They are also informing them about sanitation and mother / childcare.
They were also trained in care of children from 0 to 3 years.
This often results in them becoming involved in street gangs and crime to past the time.
This project aims to give children an alternative to this type of life on the streets.
This project is encouraging children to gain an education or vocational skills to help them find meaningful employment.
This training has been imparted to the women from the 60 self-help groups of 67 villages in Potangi block.
To her great relief, when he finally emerged, the doctor announced that the mother and child were both fine.
Today in this village all the children have been immunized. Prior to the training, there were just no institutional deliveries, although the local PHC (Primary Health Centre) is just one kilometre away.
Training local women as basic health workers to teach preventative healthcare.
UCOA began its support of the Mother and Childcare project in 2002.
UCOA has provided a motorbike to enable her to travel to the villages.
Under the four-day training programme, the SHG members were taught about pre and post natal care for the mother and care of the newborn infant from 0 to 6 months of age.
Under this training programme we have not only given them training on mother and child care but also taught them to monitor the process on their own and to spread awareness among others in the village.
We used to think that immunization is harmful for newborns so we used to hide our children when the doctors came to our village.
While describing this incident, a quiet joy gleamed on Kamala’s face.
With ongoing support the centers can give these children the encouragement they need to gain an education or vocational skills, as well as providing them with much needed emotional support.
19 million infants in the developing world have low birth weight (less than 2500 grams). 8.3 million are in India.
27 percent of children under five years have a birth certificate in India.
About 25 per cent of children under age five in the world are underweight.
About 38 per cent of children in the developing countries are initiated to breastfeeding within one hour of birth.
Whether the outbreak is due to hepatitis A or E, the measures for prevention and control are similar.
11 more species of mosquito have been incriminated as vectors of JE.
A fourfold rise in IgG antibody titre in paired sera taken at an interval of 10 days or more is confirmatory.
A killed JE vaccine is produced at the Central Research Institute (CRI), Kasauli from the brain of suckling mice inoculated with the Nakayama JE strain.
A surveillance system should be established so that any case of encephalopathy is immediately reported to the local health authorities.
Active surveillance through key individuals in the community should be encouraged in the high risk pockets, for example, places where piggeries are commercially established.
Acute viral hepatitis is such a sufficiently distinct clinical syndrome that it usually poses no difficulty in diagnosis.
Although, infected pigs do not manifest any overt symptoms of disease they develop tremendous viraemia and can infect the mosquitoes the pigs are considered as amplifying hosts.
An increase in the incidence of diarrhea and/or typhoid fever, and poor water quality indicate impending epidemic of viral hepatitis.
Antigen for conducting the tests is not yet commercially available.
Blood for serological studies should be carefully collected taking due universal precautions.
By analogy, viral hepatitis E is likely to follow an increase in acute diarrhea or typhoid fever following water contamination.
Case fatality rate is high in severe cases It is of 20 to 40% have been recorded.
Culex mosquitoes are zoophilic, feeding primarily on animals and wild birds.
Culex mosquitoes can fly for long distances (1-3 kms or even more).
Culex mosquitoes generally breed in water bodies with luxuriant vegetation.
Culex mosquitoes rest outdoors in vegetation and other shaded places but in summer may also rest indoors.
Disturbances of sensorium are reflected as lethargy, somnolence, irritability, apathy or loss of consciousness.
Ensuring that a separate sterile syringe and needle is used for each injection.
Epidemics usually coincide with the monsoons and post-monsoon period when the vector density is high.
Epidemiological and entomological investigations are useful in leading to a presumptive diagnosis of JE.
Female Culex mosquitoes can transmit the virus to other hosts after an extrinsic incubation period of 9 to 12 days.
Female Culex mosquitoes get infected after feeding on a viraemic host.
Geographical distribution-Identify the area or group affected by the outbreak-attack rates in different areas will indicate the points where contamination is occurring.
Horses are unlikely source of mosquito infection.
Horses develop active disease but viraemia is rarely present in high titre or for long periods.
IEC activities for minimising the risk of faeco-orally transmitted diseases should be undertaken in the community.
If an outbreak of JE is suspected it must be reported immediately to the district health office.
If field investigations indicate malariogenic, conditions illness is clinically compatible and anti-malaria treatment is effective, a probable digresses of malaria in made.
Immediate measures are called for to reduce the density of mosquitoes by spray of insecticides.
In areas where water supply is intermittent, on-line-booster pumps can create negative pressure in the pipeline leading to suction of sewage into the water pipeline.
In endemic areas, sporadic cases may occur throughout the year.
In human beings, viraemia is mild and lasts for a short duration.
Infection in man appears to be correlated with living in close proximity with animal reservoirs, especially pigs.
Insist that a glass syringe and needle are boiled for 20 minutes before reuse OR a sealed disposable syringe and needle is used.
Irrigated rice fields, shallow ditches and pools are common breeding places of Culex mosquitoes.
Isolation of patients and disinfection of secretions and excretions are not required as JE virus is not transmitted from person to person.
Isolation of virus from blood is almost impossible as viraemia is mild and of short duration.
Isolation of virus from CSF is not routinely done for diagnostic purposes.
It is emphasized that the only way to reduce mortality due to JE is proper clinical management of cases.
It is, therefore important, that cases of JE are referred to a hospital as early as possible if encephalitis is suspected.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a disease of public health importance because of its epidemic potential and high case fatality rate.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease.
Japanese Encephalitis is caused by a group B arbovirus (flavivirus).
JE virus has its natural cycle in wild or domestic vertebrates and mosquitoes.
JE’s epidemics have also been reported in peri-urban areas where similar conditions may exist.
Long-term measures include the recommended steps for vector control under the National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP).
Maintain surveillance for acute diarrhea, typhoid fever, and jaundice cases.
Man is an incidental host of Japanese Encephalitis (JE)’s virus.
Man to man transmission of JE has not been documented.
Manage the existing increase in diarrhea and/or typhoid fever cases, and take corrective measures to prevent the impending outbreak of viral hepatitis.
Mosquitoes belonging to the Culex vishnui group (Culex vishnui, Culex pseudovishnui, Culex tritaeneorhynchus) are the most important vector species in India.
Necessary field investigations must be carried out in the area of residence of the patient to check for amplifying host and vector.
One of the complications of P.falciparum malaria is encephalopathy.
Patients should be referred to the district hospital as the peripheral health facilities may not have adequate resources to manage serious cases.
Patients who recover from the acute episode may have neurological sequelae.
Periodic sanitary surveys should be undertaken, especially before monsoon, for sewer overflow, and leakage in water supply system.
Pigs are the major vertebrate hosts of JE virus.
Pockets of high risk should be identified so that these areas could be given more attention with regard to control measures, health educational activities and field supervision.
Regular monitoring of water quality by examination of water samples for residual chlorine and/or coliform organisms on a random basis.
Since malaria is relatively common, the diagnosis of malaria should be considered.
Such areas would include villages and peri-urban areas where pigs are reared, especially if these are close to paddy fields which are rich breeding places for Culex mosquitoes.
Supportive treatment and good nursing care can significantly reduce case fatality rate of JE.
The clinical features of JE are those of encephalitis.
The Culex mosquitoes remain infected for life and the average life period of a mosquito is about 21 days.
The currently available evidence does not indicate major role of cattle in transmission of JE.
The diagnosis of Japanese Encephalitis is confirmed by laboratory tests.
The diagnosis of JE is supported by serological tests.
The facilities for preparation and examination of blood slides should be made available at each PHC.
The first major outbreak of JE occurred in Bankura and Burdwan districts, West Bengal, in 1973 and since then it has spread to many states/UTs of country.
The incubation period in man, following Culex mosquitoes bite probably varies from 5 to 15 days.
The infection of JE is transmitted through the bite of an infected culicine mosquito.
The isolation or destruction of the amplifying hosts (usually pigs), which are the main source of infection, is not practical as these animals do not show any overt signs of illness and it is not possible to identify infected animals.
The mosquitoes are outdoor as well as indoor feeders.
The patient may develop difficulty of speech and other neurological deficits like ocular palsies, hemiplegia, tremor and ataxia.
The patient will give a history of acute onset with fever and change in behavior or sensorium lasting for more than 24 hours.
The presence of risk factors such as the vector and amplifying hosts supports the diagnosis of JE.
The preventive measures are directed at reducing the vector density and in taking personal protection to prevent the bite of mosquitoes.
The public should also be informed to take necessary precautions against mosquito bite such as use of full sleeved clothes, mosquito nets at night and mosquito repellent creams.
The recombinant DNA vaccine and the plasma derived should be administered as per recommendations by manufacturers.
The recombinant DNA vaccine and the plasma derived, both are safe and effective.
The recombinant DNA vaccine and the plasma derived, vaccines are available in single and multi-dose vials.
The risk increases in areas where ecological conditions facilitate transmission to man.
The tests include detection of IgM antibodies which appear after the first week of onset of symptoms and are detectable for one to three months after the acute episode.
The total number of overt cases per village will be a few and the local health personnel must be alert about any case(s) of encephalopathy in their areas.
The transmission of JE virus cycle is maintained in animals and birds.
The virus is antigenically related to other flaviviruses including dengue, west nile and yellow fever viruses.
The virus of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) infects mainly animals and birds.
There are other diseases which have shorter incubation period and are also transmitted by faeco-oral route.
There are two types of hepatitis B vaccines available - the recombinant DNA vaccine and the plasma derived
There is no evidence that gammaglobulins or corticosteroids have a beneficial effect.
There is no specific treatment of Japanese ncephalitis.
They are acute watery diarrhea (incubation period: a few days) and typhoid fever (incubation period: 1-3 weeks).
Though JE is primarily a disease of rural agricultural areas, where vector mosquitoes proliferate in close association with pigs and other animal reservoirs.
Treatment should start without waiting for serological laboratory results.
Typhoid fever is another important endemic disease which can give rise to symptoms mimicking Japanese Encephalitis.
Typhoid fever should be excluded by careful history and physical examination and blood culture for S.typhi, if necessary.
Vaccination of humans against JE is the only measure currently available for prevention of JE on long-term basis.
Viral hepatitis E has a long incubation period of usually 1-2 months (not less than 15 days).
Water birds such as pond herons, cattle egrets, poultry birds and ducks play a significant role in the natural history of JE virus.
When an outbreak occurs or when the risk of such outbreaks is high, the cooperation of other government departments, non-governmental agencies and the community often becomes necessary.
5 cases of similar illness of acute onset within an incubation period or one death in a village is being used as a criteria in one state to constitute an outbreak.
A list of the laboratories with full address, telephone and fax numbers along with the type of tests conducted is recommended to be maintained.
A map of the area or even a rough sketch can be drawn showing where each reported case resides to indicate geographical distribution of cases and to identify high risk pockets.
A single case of such diseases should be treated as an outbreak, e.g. poliomyelitis, guinea worm and yaws.
A thorough knowledge about clinical symptoms and epidemiological parameters is important for outbreak investigations.
Active surveillance is active search for cases.
Active surveillance should be maintained until the outbreak is over (usually it is when the double incubation period has elapsed after the last case).
Active surveillance through peripheral health personnel, personnel from other government departments, NGOs and key community representatives provides additional information about cases who may not have been seen at government health facilities.
After an outbreak has been confirmed, specific interventions will depend on the cause of the outbreak and mode of transmission.
After establishing the existence of an outbreak and verifying the diagnosis, it becomes important to accurately define and count the cases.
An effective surveillance system is essential or planning, implementation and monitoring the disease control programmes.
An effective surveillance system must be established in each district.
An important purpose of a surveillance system is to prevent outbreaks or detect them in the early stage, and therefore the health personnel must be responsive to the warning signals.
An outbreak or epidemic is defined as the occurrence in a community of cases of an illness clearly in excess of expected numbers.
Case fatality rate may increase due to certain factors such as high malnutrition rates in young children or limited knowledge in the community about the danger signs of severe illness.
Cases should be described in terms of age, sex, occupation, socio-economic parameters, migration, vaccination history and other relevant characteristics.
Cases tend to cluster, and it may also be useful to mark affected schools or other institutions on the map in addition to residential locations.
Collection of unnecessary samples is discouraged as it places a heavy load on the laboratory and some tests are very expensive.
Community level IEC activities should be supported so that key messages regarding the control of the diseases and prevention of outbreaks are known.
Concerned medical and health personnel should be trained in the principles of outbreak investigations including recognition of early warning signals, epidemiological and entomological parameters, differential diagnosis, laboratory support and specific control interventions.
Control measures are most effective when selective interventions are applied early.
Data should be regularly analyzed as suggested in a separate module "Surveillance of Epidemic Prone Diseases" available from National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD).
Depending on the disease and the resources available to investigate the outbreak, it may even be desirable to conduct house-to-house visits, especially in the homes of contacts of cases.
Differential diagnoses of some of the important and common clinical syndromes have been given in this document.
Diseases can also cause outbreaks with the potential to spread rapidly and cause many deaths.
Diseases for which eradication or elimination goals have been set.
During outbreaks, analysis of cases by time will help to document the trend of the epidemic and to monitor the effectiveness of the containment measures.
During the period of the outbreak, all the cases of the disease under consideration occurring in that area should be identified and listed.
Efforts therefore, should be made to investigate all the outbreaks as well as threatened oubreaks.
First reports about an outbreak will be based on clinical syndrome and diagnosis will be presumptive.
For easy reference, the epidemiological parameters should be available in tabular form.
For some diseases even a single case (acute poliomyelitis, guinea worm, unusual acute severe episode of an illness of unknown aetiology) constitutes an outbreak.
For some laboratory tests, samples may need to be sent to the state, regional or national levels.
Health education material which has been prepared in advance and field tested will be useful if there is an outbreak in the area because such material may be required at short notice.
If the outbreak is unusual, case fatality rates are very high, aetiology cannot be determined or if the clinical syndrome had not been reported in the area before, the state officer and NICD would be expected to assist the district authorities in investigations.
In case of endemic diseases, it is also useful to present previous data on a line graph.
In investigating an outbreak, it is necessary to provide a detailed description of outbreaks in terms of time, place and person.
In situations of doubt, whether an illness meets the case definition, a second opinion may be sought.
In some circumstances, community assistance may be enlisted for house-to-house visits.
In some situations, serial spot maps, by week or by month (or by disease generation) may provide insight into the pattern of the spread of the disease over time.
In the event of an outbreak, the state nodal officer is required to be notified immediately.
Increase in the total number of cases does not, however, necessarily indicate increase in the incidence of the disease.
Inventories should be checked before the expected seasonal increase of cases.
Investigations must be made, including epidemiological, entomological and laboratory, to rule out the more common causes first.
It is important that adequate facilities are established at the district level for rapid and efficient analysis of the surveillance data.
It is important that information from surveillance be recorded in a standardised manner.
It is necessary to know the clinical and epidemiological features of the diseases to effectively investigate and control outbreaks.
It is not necessary to collect specimen from all cases as it is not essential for the outcome of outbreak investigations and control measures.
It is useful to have a short list of `warning signals' which should trigger an investigation.
It might be useful to convene a meeting of the concerned departments, community representatives and the NGOs before the expected seasonal increase in cases of diseases.
It should be noted that during an outbreak a higher percentage of more severe cases may occur.
It will only be possible if mothers know about signs and symptoms of pneumonia i.e. increased respiratory rate and chest indrawing.
Laboratory confirmation of clinically-diagnosed cases or identification of the etiological agent may sometimes be necessary.
Many communicable diseases are endemic in India.
Many of diseases have seasonal and cyclic trends which can be discerned through the surveillance system.
Medical officers are encouraged to expand the list and include other conditions prevalent in their areas.
Mother must consult the health facilities whenever signs and symptoms of pneumonia appear for proper treatment of cases.
Much time and effort may be wasted due to misdiagnosis.
Oubreaks should be seen as excellent opportunities to analyse why they occur, identify high risk areas and groups, and evaluate control measures.
Outbreaks of new and reemerging infections may also occur.
Persons who are ill and meet the case definition for the outbreak disease should be entered onto what is called a "line-listing".
Precautionary measures need to be taken and decided where and when to seek medical help in a timely manner.
Precautionary measures taken in anticipation of an outbreak can prevent an acute public health emergency and save lives.
Since the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) is the nodal office at the national level, it is expected that notification of the outbreak would be made immediately to NICD, also indicating if any technical support is required.
Software such as EPI INFO are particularly useful in maintaining and analyzing line lists of cases of various diseases.
Some laboratory tests are expected to be done at the PHC level; others may be available only at the district level.
Some life saving medicines such as ORS packets may also be kept at the village level especially in the high risk pockets and areas which might become inaccessible during the monsoons.
Some mechanism for briefing the press should also be established.
Special emphasis must be placed on proper collection of clinical samples, their storage and transportation.
States and districts should establish criteria on the number of cases that constitute an epidemic based on their local situations.
Such analysis provides valuable epidemiological information regarding high risk groups, areas and factors.
Such graphs help to demonstrate the magnitude of the outbreak compared to the previous reported incidence, rapidity of spread of the disease and evaluation of control efforts.
Such help will be more forthcoming if mechanisms for interaction have been developed before the onset of an outbreak.
Such mappings may assist in identifying the sources of infection.
Suggestions have been made for clinical syndromes, outbreaks of which are more commonly reported.
Suspect case definition may be used to identify cases.
Telephone facilities are expected at the PHC level.
The district officers may also need technical and other support in the event of an unusual outbreak or if the diagnosis is not confirmed.
The epidemic curve can be helpful in identifying the index (first) case or cases, and may even suggest patterns or modes of transmission.
The first step of outbreak investigation is to confirm the diagnosis of as many reported cases as possible.
The information is also necessary to assess the quality of the national programmes (if relevant).
The majority of the cases are expected to fall within the standard case definitions.
The medical and health personnel should establish contact with community leaders and other key personnel in their areas which would be useful in receiving early warning signals and in soliciting community support during an outbreak.
The nodal officer and other key personnel should receive training in the use of computers.
The nodal officer at the district level, in consultation with the concerned programme officers, must ensure that essential supplies are in place in the peripheral health facilities and that adequate buffer stocks are maintained at the district level.
The nodal officer should identify gaps in laboratory services at each level that can be filled within the given resources.
The number of cases which are needed to be called an outbreak varies according to several factors.
The onset of illness of the cases should be graphed by hours (for example, in food poisoning), days, weeks or months, as appropriate.
The prevention and control of outbreaks require the close and active cooperation of the community.
The primary purpose of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak, limit its spread to other areas and assess how prevention strategies can be further strengthened to reduce or eliminate the risk of such outbreaks in the future.
The reported cases should be investigated by a medical officer to confirm the diagnosis.
Timely treatment and follow-up of cases and contacts is important to reduce mortality.
Under such a situation, samples should be collected carefully from a few selected cases.
Under the national disease surveillance programme, it is expected that the district and state levels will be linked to NICD through e-mail and fax.
Valuable information can be obtained by contacting key community representatives, especially if the outbreak is focal.
Variations in the number of reporting sites, completeness of reporting, geographical size of the catchment area and size of the population are factors that must be taken into consideration while analysing reports.
When an outbreak occurs or when the risk of such outbreaks is high, the cooperation of other government departments, non-governmental agencies and the community often becomes necessary.
While an outbreak is usually limited to a small focal area, an epidemic covers larger geographic areas and has more than one focal point.
While outbreaks cannot always be predicted or prevented, recognition of early warning signals, timely investigations and application of specific control measures can limit the spread of the outbreak and prevent deaths.
While preparing tables, the population characteristics, for example related to age and sex, should be grouped accordingly.
Action should be initiated based on clinical, epidemiological and entomological findings.
Alert health personnel and hospitals to report increase or clustering of cases or deaths.
All health facilities should maintain records of patients seen, including in OPD.
An effective surveillance system can provide an early warning signal and prevent outbreaks.
An important objective of outbreak investigations is to reduce mortality rates by early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
Appropriate sterilisation of needles (boiling for at least 20 minutes) and screening of all blood donations for HBsAg, HIV.
Bubonic plague and visceral leishmaniasis are other important vector borne diseases.
Case fatality rates can be significantly reduced through effective Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT).
Chickenpox in higher age group is often serious and large number of patients need to be admitted in health facility, particularly Infectious Diseases Hospitals.
Community participation for safe practices with regard to storing water and food handling are essential to prevent outbreaks.
Control activities and treatment of patients should not be delayed pending laboratory confirmation of diagnosis.
Documentation of the epidemic is an important step in outbreak investigation.
During the course of investigations, universal infection control precautions are expected to be implemented.
Ensure that the health personnel are adequately trained and that the recommended guidelines are followed in the hospitals.
Entomological investigations are an important aspect of field investigations as a number of outbreaks are vector borne.
Entomological investigations are useful to confirm or rule out the probable cause of the outbreak, especially if results of laboratory tests are not available.
Food handlers and suspected food also need attention during investigations.
Food-borne diseases include food poisoning due to toxins produced by micro-organisms (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus) and chemicals, as well as food-borne infections (e.g. Salmonella infection).
Food-borne outbreaks are very common in our country.
For influenza and chickenpox, no vaccine is currently available in India and in absence of specific therapy, control of their outbreaks is a difficult proposition.
Health education and public awareness and co-operation are important to control an outbreak.
High vector density is a reflection of the unsatisfactory field implementation and monitoring of vector control measures.
High vector density is a warning signal as the risk of vector borne outbreaks increases under such conditions.
Ideally, the place of immunization should also be examined to assess quality of the cold chain.
If dengue fever/ dengue haemorrahagic fever is suspected or confirmed, vector surveillance and vector control activities should be taken up with high priority.
If information is available there is less likely to be panic and chaos, and community support will also be forthcoming.
If the community knows how the outbreak spreads and what measures they can take in their own families, the risks can be considerably reduced.
If there is a sudden increase in cases or clustering of cases in an area, field investigations should be carried out and necessary corrective action taken.
Immunization cards or immunization registers should be checked to verify the immunization status.
Immunization status is an important descriptive as well as analytical parameter.
In areas where leishmaniasis is prevalent or there is a potential threat of leishmaniasis or plague, vector monitoring and IEC activities are recommended.
In case of meningococcal meningitis, though a bivalent vaccine is available, it is not routinely used.
In fact, all the waterborne infections (viral, bacterial and parasitic) can be transmitted through contamination of food.
In large outbreaks, a sample of population may be interviewed, or the investigations may be by case control studies.
In outbreak of meningococcal meningitis, vaccination of selected high risk groups only is recommended.
In several countries, it has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, depriving severely ill patients from a valuable treatment.
In those who are immunized with two doses, protection lasts for 3-6 months only.
Inadequately sterilised needles and syringes, sharp instruments that penetrate the skin, and unscreened blood are common source of parenterally transmitted infections.
Information on immunization coverage may also be available through past vaccination coverage evaluation surveys.
Information on natural disasters like floods, cyclone, drought, earth quake etc., as available may be utilized for the description of the epidemic.
Injections can transmit a variety of infections including HIV and hepatitis B and C.
It is also important that the public and administrators are aware of inappropriate measures so that much time and resources are not diverted for measures which are ineffective.
It is more appropriate to determine attack rates rather than absolute numbers because rates take into account the variations in the population size of different groups.
It is not necessary while submitting the preliminary report to wait for the results of laboratory tests which have been sent to laboratories outside the district and which may take sometime.
It is particularly important to inform the public that most cases of epidemic prone diseases can be managed if treatment is started at the earliest.
It is suggested that action for preparation of health education material and key messages is taken for epidemic prone diseases.
Majority of the infected individuals have no symptoms.
Man-made situation like developmental projects on irrigation and industries may create environmental conditions conducive for disease transmission.
Mass chemoprophylaxis is not only ineffective in preventing the spread of the disease, but it also diverts manpower and resources from effective measures.
No country requires travelers to have a cholera vaccination certificate.
On the other hand, the risk is low if the density is maintained below critical levels.
Percentage Immunization coverage is estimated by dividing the total number of doses (measles and BCG) or third doses (OPV and DPT) of the vaccine administered to a specific age-group by the total population of that age-group in the affected village(s) or urban area.
Pigs are considered to be amplifying hosts of Japanese Encephalitis virus.
Procedures that require the collection of blood and other clinical samples should be undertaken carefully.
Publication of the report in a technical journal or newsletter will ensure wider accessibility to the information.
Rates of illness in those who did or did not consume a specific food item are compared, and relative risk is calculated for each food item.
Regular monitoring is essential to ensure that breeding sites are eliminated in a timely manner.
Results of some tests can be obtained locally and quickly.
Setting up check-posts requires massive inputs and diverts attention from other more useful control measures.
Similarly information on drinking water supply and Environmental sanitation is crucial for the investigation.
Some suggestions to develop the key messages are given in the documents on specific diseases.
Special emphasis must be placed on proper collection, labelling transportation and storage of clinical samples.
Such rates are generally computed by dividing the number of cases in a population group by the population size of the same group.
Such tests include water quality monitoring if a water-borne disease is suspected.
The Aedes mosquito (vector for dengue fever) is a domestic breeder preferring clean water containers.
The age-groups vaccinated should be fully assessed as inclusion of older children may give a false sense of higher coverage.
The control measures should be directed towards all stages of the life cycle of the vector.
The cooperation of the community is imperative to control mosquito breeding by taking simple precautionary measures.
The descriptive epidemiology will help to define the population groups at high risk of disease in terms of age-groups, geographical location, activity etc., immunisation status and other characteristics.
The determination of Immunization coverage levels is crucial if the outbreak is due to a vaccine preventable disease.
The factors that will influence decision will be the severity of the disease, its potential for spread to other areas, maximum incubation period and the accessibility of the affected area to routine health services.
The first three diseases are vaccine preventable and their outbreaks reflect poor immunization activity in the community.
The frequency and duration of follow-up visits will depend on many factors and decisions will have to be taken at the local level.
The immunization activities, including periodicity of the immunization sessions, quantities of vaccines received and cold chain system, should be reviewed.
The Immunization status in the community can be assessed through Immunization performance records available at the PHC.
The immunization status of each case must be carefully investigated to ascertain the number of doses of the vaccine received by the patient.
The implicated food would give the highest attack rates, and/or the highest relative risk.
The important air-borne diseases those can cause outbreaks are measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, chickenpox, meningococcal meningitis, and influenza.
The information will be useful in drawing up long term strategies for reducing the risk of the outbreaks in future and in more effective handling of the outbreak if it were to occur.
The local pradhan and panchayat members should be aware that if there is an acute case of fever with altered sensorium, the local health authorities should be notified immediately.
The main findings of the outbreak should also be discussed with the members of the rapid response team and the members of the inter-departmental committee.
The results can be added in the final report.
The results of laboratory investigations should be included in the outbreak investigation report.
The risk of some vector borne outbreaks increases in the presence of animals or birds.
The risk of vector borne diseases has increased in the urban and peri-urban areas due to the changing life styles and industrial activities which have made the surrounding environment more conducive for the breeding of mosquitoes and other vectors.
The study of environmental conditions and the dynamics of its interaction with the population and causative agents will help in the formulation of hypothesis on genesis of the epidemic, which will make the basis for the control measures to be taken.
The value of selective chemotherapy of household contacts is also doubtful.
Travel and trade restrictions between countries or different areas within a country do not prevent the spread of cholera.
Useful lessons can be learnt if the documentation is complete and data properly analysed.
Vaccination campaigns divert resources and manpower from more useful control activities.
Vaccines that are currently available against cholera do not have high vaccine efficacy rates.
Vector control measures should be applied as per the calendar of activities to optimize impact for prevention of outbreaks.
Vector surveillance should be immediately undertaken in other high risk pockets even if no case has been reported from the area.
Verbal history should be used only if such records cannot be obtained.
Where piggeries have been established, regular monitoring and periodic anti-vector measures are indicated.
Whereas in the past contaminated food processed in the home exposed a few individuals, the food processed and distributed extensively by the industry could result in the exposure of a large number of people.
While investigating an outbreak of food-borne infection, efforts should be made to interview all who are exposed for history of food consumption and illness, if any.
While investigating outbreaks of haemorrahagic fever or if parenteral route of transmission is suspected, protective gear such as gloves, masks etc. are expected to be worn by health personnel treating or investigating patients.
While the key messages will essentially remain the same for all areas, the language and style may need to be adapted to local needs.
With respect to physical environment, the data on rainfall, humidity and temperature are available in the district meteorological centers.
A case of meningitis usually presents with sudden onset of high grade fever, severe headache, stiff neck with or without altered sensorium.
A commercially available latex agglutination test may provide the aetiology of some agents of meningitis i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae B, Meningococci AandC.
A lumber puncture for demonstration and/or isolation of organisms from CSF is essential.
A majority of Hepatitis E cases however, occur in young adults.
A mental apathy and dullness is common and delirium may develop.
Acute fever is caused by a variety of viruses.
Acute respiratory infections leading to pneumonia are major causes of morbidity and mortality in India, especially in early childhood.
Acute viral hepatitis is such a sufficiently distinct clinical syndrome that it usually poses no difficulty in diagnosis.
Acute watery diarrhoea in young children is the most common problem.
Although jaundice may occur due to many reasons, viral hepatitis is responsible for the majority of cases with jaundice in our country.
Although large number of cases are reported, TB meningitis is not expected to occur in the form of explosive outbreaks.
At least 6 agents (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV and HGV) can cause viral hepatitis.
At this stage patient may present as fever with altered sensorium.
Cases are confirmed by serology for JE antibodies (demonstratin of IgM antibodies or four fold rise in IgG antibodies in paired serum samples).
Cases occur throughout the year, with a seasonal increase in the monsoon and post-monsoon months.
Cases of haemorrahagic fever are expected to be relatively rare and few in number.
Cases of shock syndrome have not been reported and case fatality rates are low.
Clinicians are aware of the need to report such cases immediately so that further field investigations could be carried out.
Clinicians must, however, keep in mind TB meningitis as a differential diagnosis, especially if the patient is a young child.
Clustering and sudden increase of acute cases of fever may be due to malaria, dengue fever or other viral fevers.
Death may occur within a few hours of severe episodes of acute watery diarrhoea.
Diagnosis can be confirmed by typical clinical presentation, age group affected and vaccination history (measles).
Disturbances of sensorium are reflected as lethargy, somnolence, irritability, apathy or loss of consciousness.
Due to rapid means of transport and increase in the number of travellers, there is a potential risk of importation of these infections.
Even a single case of encephalopathy therefore reflects a relatively large number of cases of the disease in the community.
Even if a clustering of a few cases in older children and adults is noticed, investigation should be initiated promptly for impending outbreaks of these infections so that appropriate action for treatment of cases and control of outbreak is promptly taken.
Feco-orally transmitted hepatitis E virus has been responsible for virtually all the outbreaks of viral hepatitis in India.
Fever with altered sensorium (encephalopathy) may occur as a result of complication of some diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, measles and pertussis.
Fever with rash may be due to measles or chicken pox.
Focal neurological deficits may or may not be present.
Focal outbreaks of acute watery diarrhoea can occur.
Haemorrhagic fever can also be caused by chikungunya virus.
However, the type of clinical presentation and other epidemiological and entomological parameters may help in presumptive diagnosis.
If a clustering of acute fever cases have been reported and dengue fever is suspected on clinical grounds and entomological investigations, a reported case of haemorrahagic fever from the area will clinch diagnosis.
If any case of encephalopathy due to unknown aetiology occurs in an area not known for JE, it should be reported immediately to the state health authorities for appropriate investigations.
If cases of severe dehydration or death following acute watery diarrhoea are reported in patients older than 5 years of age, cholera should be suspected and control measures at the field level should be initiated as per guidelines.
If patient present with jaundice, renal involvement and hemorrhage, leptospirosis should be strongly suspected.
If the increase meets the criteria of an outbreak, necessary clinical, epidemiological, laboratory and entomological investigations must be conducted to confirm diagnosis.
In endemic areas cases are, therefore, seen more often in children under 15 years of age as the adult population is already immune through natural infection.
In majority of the cases, individuals develop immunity after infection.
In the absence of ORT, high mortality rates have been recorded.
Increase in the acute fever cases may be due to typhoid fever which is also relatively common in many parts of the country.
Infection control precautions must be practiced while investigating or treating patients, and handling infectious biological material.
Investigation of the case of haemorrahagic fever may identify a dengue fever outbreak.
Isolation of virus from CSF or brain tissue is not routinely done.
It is important that the community and the peripheral health personnel are aware of the danger sign of blood in the stools (bloody diarrhoea) so that medical help is sought immediately.
JE infection is usually mild with no overt clinical symptoms or mild fever with headache.
JE patients will give a history of acute onset with fever and change in behavior or sensorium lasting for more than 24 hours.
Leptospirosis is emerging as an important cause of jaundice in many parts of country.
Malaria is considered as the cause of the outbreak.
Malaria is relatively common in our country.
Meningitis may occur due to tubercular, viral or pyogenic organisms.
Meningitis, pulmonary and cardiac involvement may also be present in some cases.
Once pneumonia is suspected, the specific etiologic diagnosis is necessary for proper management to prevent mortality and reduce further transmission.
One of the complications of malaria caused by P.falciparum is encephalopathy.
Outbreaks of dysentery can occur in children. Such outbreaks have the potential of causing a large number of deaths unless specific treatment is initiated in a timely manner.
Patient develops nonspecific symptoms including malaise, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, and mild pain in abdomen.
Patient should be hospitalized immediately to reduce mortality rates.
Patients should be examined to see if the clinical presentation is compatible with the case definition of typhoid fever.
Patients with acute pneumonia usually present with acute fever, chills, cough, chest pain, other non specific symptoms, varying degree of respiratory insufficiency, and infiltrate on chest X-ray.
Poliovirus infection is the most important cause of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children.
Presence of nuchal rigidity and positive Kerning and Brudzinski signs confirm the clinical diagnosis.
Prompt action is important to check the spread of the outbreak and to provide oral rehydration therapy which is life saving.
Recently, outbreaks of hepatitis B occurred in defined rural communities of Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan states which were epidemiologically linked to the use of unsafe injections by unqualified medical practitioners.
Secondary household cases during the outbreaks are uncommon.
Severe forms of haemorrahagic fever with high case fatality rates due to yellow fever and ebola fever have been reported from some countries.
Since malaria is relatively common, the diagnosis of malaria should be first considered.
Since samples for virus isolation need special handling, it is appropriate that specialised institutions such as NICD Delhi and NIV Pune are also involved in the investigations in the early stages.
Since typhoid fever is very common in our country, it should always be excluded by careful history, physical examination and blood culture for S.typhi.
Some diseases like plague, anthrax, leptospirosis, influenza, melioidosis and hanta virus infection may result in severe outbreaks with mainly pulmonary involvement.
Some of the diseases such as dengue fever may present in severe form such as haemorrahagic fever and shock syndrome.
Specific types of viral hepatitis in individual patients can't be distinguished on clinical grounds.
State and national authorities must be notified immediately by the fastest routes of communication.
Such complications occur in a relatively small proportion of the cases.
Such outbreaks have also been reported following outbreaks of measles.
The case fatality rate may reach up to 20% among those infected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.
The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of rising antibodies, or isolation of leptospires from blood during acute illness and from urine after the first week.
The diagnosis is confirmed if field investigations indicate malariogenic conditions, illness is clinically compatible and anti-malaria treatment is effective.
The disease is clinically indistinguishable from dengue fever.
The disease is usually characterized by abrupt onset of high grade fever, myalgia and conjuctivial suffusion.
The duration of jaundice is variable, but usually lasts 1-3 weeks.
The expression of icterus appears to increase with increasing age.
The facilities for making blood slides and examining them should be available at each PHC.
The focal neurological signs may be stationary or progressive.
The outbreaks were marked by high case fatality rates.
The patient may develop difficulty of speech and other neurological deficits like ocular palsies, hemiplegia, tremor and ataxia.
The patient with JE may present with signs of encephalitis.
The possibility of polio should be considered for any case of AFP, even in areas with high OPV coverage levels and a very low incidence of poliomyelitis.
The report of even a single case of haemorrahagic fever from an area which has a reported increase of acute fever cases compatible with dengue fever as well as a high density of Aedes aegypti is a strong indication in favour of dengue fever.
The type of virus can be identified only by laboratory tests.
The younger the age group, the more susceptible they are to dehydration.
These outbreaks are invariably linked to contamination of water supply.
They can be caused by a variety of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
Travel history or close contact with those who have recently traveled abroad should be obtained if the above infections are suspected.
Tuberculous meningitis is relatively common in many parts of our country.
Typhoid fever is usually characterized by gradual onset of malaise, lethargy, headache, and myalgia, loss of appetite and fever that increases in stepwise fashion to reach 39-41 ° C in 5-7 days period.
Unless treated promptly with antibiotics, it is marked by high case fatality rates.
Usually not more than a few such cases (1-2) of JE occur in one village.
Water borne and food borne diseases can present with a variety of clinical symptoms.
While diarrhoeal episodes may also occur in adults, these usually do not result in severe dehydration or death.
208 were found positive for malarial parasite (P.falciparum 36, P.vivax 172).
2294 blood slides were collected in village Banyani upto 2.11.91. 325 were found positive for malarial parasite (P.falciparum 131, P.vivax 194).
27 cases in SD Block were also considered an outbreak.
81 slides were found positive for malarial parasite (Plasmodium vivax 66, Plasmodium falciparum 15).
A comprehensive overview of the public health consequences of various forms of disasters may be found in Noji (1997).
A house to house survey revealed 27 cases of jaundice in 1435 population within a reference period of 3 months.
A line list of admitted cases was available in the primary health centre, Galore.
A medical specialist examined 63 patients, of village Banyani, of fever.
A patient from village Banyani (population 3403) came to the OPD of PHC on 7.10.1991 with complaints of fever, headache, bodyaches and chills.
A special hepatitis A vaccination programme was launched among 3–15-year-olds in selected areas.
A team of doctors from the PHC surveyed the village on 8.10.1991.
About 3500 wells and other water sources were contaminated and wastewater-treatment plants were rendered inoperable.
About 40% of the positive slides were due to P.falciparum.
Acute paralytic poliomyelitis is characterized by fever followed by abrupt onset of weakness or paralysis of limbs which does not progress after first 3 days.
Adequate staff members who are qualified and/or oriented/trained for undertaking disease surveillance work.
All except malnutrition are communicable diseases directly related to environmental health conditions, and even malnutrition is greatly exacerbated by communicable disease.
All reports of outbreaks of typhoid fever, salmonellosis, shigellosis, acute diarrhoea, viral hepatitis A, tularaemia, invasive meningococcal disease, toxoplasmosis, leptospirosis and Lyme disease were evaluated.
All the residents had access to and used only sanitary latrine.
Almost all the outbreaks of viral hepatitis in India are due to faeco-orally transmitted hepatitis E.
An occasional outbreak may be due to hepatitis A.
Analysis of the data on clinical features in the admitted patients revealed that they initially presented with fever (100%), headache (74%), pain abdomen (18%), vomiting (17%), diarrhoea (15%), constipation (7%), palpable spleen (57%) and palpable liver (13%).
Besides waterborne and vector-borne disease, there may also be major epidemics of highly contagious diseases—those spread by personal contact.
Between 6 and 10% of the refugee population died during the month after arrival in Zaire.
Bidi rolling provided the clue to the genesis of the outbreak in the village Banyani.
Both natural disasters and armed conflict may result in the breakage of water mains or the interruption of electricity supplies required to pump water.
By the third week of the refugee influx, relief efforts began to have a significant impact.
Camps established to provide food relief during famine are a special case, as large numbers of people who are already weak and possibly ill are likely to remain in such camps for a long time.
Cramps, tingling sensation, and hypo-anesthesia of palms and soles are usually present in GBS.
Disaster-affected people are particularly vulnerable to communicable diseases when the disaster and its immediate consequences reduce resistance to disease because of malnutrition, stress, fatigue, etc. and when post-disaster living conditions are unsanitary.
District authorities were informed about the outbreak and a treatment centre was established at village Banyani to treat the patients.
During the emergency phase of a relief operation, death rates should be expressed as deaths/10 000 per day to allow for the detection of sudden changes.
During the period from 18 May to 19 June, 1991, 392 cases of clinically suspected typhoid fever were treated at the outpatient department of PHC Galore, district Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh.
During the same period, 2184 slides were collected from other villages of PHC within 5 kilometer of village Banyani.
During the survey undertaken on 8.10.1991, 466 blood slides were collected from fever cases.
Earthquakes can trigger landslides that block rivers, causing flooding.
Eastern areas of the Czech Republic were severely flooded in the summer of 1997.
Exceptions are the epidemics occurring in chronic emergencies triggered by drought and civil strife, such as those that occurred in Africa in the 1980s and 1990s.
Fever is usually absent in GBS and the paralysis is symmetrical and distal.
For instance, in the Andes it is not uncommon for a volcanic eruption to melt ice and snow, creating floods, mud flows and rock falls.
Functioning disease surveillance systems and intact environmental health services are crucial in protecting public health and in responding to these outbreaks when they occur in times of disaster.
He also informed the medical officer about a large number of cases having similar illness in the village, of whom many had died.
High winds, coastal storms, mud slides and even earthquakes can all result in standing water, especially where a “cascade” of physical effects occurs.
In all cases, excess standing water can promote the breeding of insect disease vectors, or contaminate water supplies with waste or sewage.
In eastern Zaire in July 1994, the CMR among one million Rwandan refugees ranged from 34.1 to 54.5/10 000 per day, among the highest ever recorded.
In general, health workers should be concerned when crude mortality rates (CMRs) in a displaced population exceed 1/10 000 per day, or when under-five mortality rates exceed 2/10000 per day.
Isolation of wild poliovirus from AFP cases or contacts confirms the diagnosis of acute poliomyelitis.
It is noteworthy that District Farukhabad did not report any case of falciparum malaria in the last 3 years.
Koraput district was reported to be affected by an "outbreak" of acute gastroenteritis (GE) in July-August, 1991. About 2270 cases and 413 deaths occurred during this period.
Laboratory should have access to electronic communication network for rapid transmission of results and/or early warning signals.
Laboratory should have adequate inventory/or access to basic material that may be needed for surveillance and investigation of outbreak or to provide support in times of disasters.
Laboratory should have the facilities to wash and sterilize glassware etc. needed for collection and transportation of clinical and environmental specimens as well as for separating serum from blood samples.
Many cases of polio have initially been diagnosed as GBS even by experts. Accordingly, WHO recommends that stool specimens should be tested for poliovirus on all cases of GBS less than 5 years of age.
Many outbreaks are on record where a varying number of cases of jaundice (a few cases to many thousands) occurred in a short period.
More than 200000 people were left without electricity and 30 000 without gas.
Most of the cases had only diarrhoea and vomiting.
NICD team visited the affected area during 1-3 November 1991.
No viral hepatitis A was reported from the populations vaccinated.
None of patients of village Banyani had signs of meningitis.
On inquiry, it was found that bidi rolling and agriculture were the main occupations in village Banyani and a few surrounding villages.
Other hazards may lead standing water or pollute, or interrupt drinking-water supplies.
Outbreaks have been invariably linked to contaminated water supply.
Paralysis is not present at birth and is not associated with serious injury or mental retardation.
Paralytic poliomyelitis is most often confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), transverse myelitis, and traumatic paralysis due to sciatic nerve injury.
Postdisaster analysis showed that leptospirosis had increased threefold, but that there had been no demonstrable flooding effects in the other diseases targeted.
Recently, a few outbreaks of hepatitis B epidemiologically linked to unsafe injections have also been reported.
Recommended follow-up measures included monitoring and controlling rodents.
Residents of a locality in North West Delhi (SD Block, Pitampura : population 1435) felt an unusual increase in the cases of jaundice in April, 1994.
Routine measures, such as measles immunization, vitamin A supplements, standard disease treatment protocols and community outreach programmes, were established in each camp, and the water-distribution system began to provide an average of 5–10 liters per person per day.
Salmonella typhi was isolated in 10 of 25 blood samples examined in the laboratories of Medical College, Shimla.
Sewer pipes and sewage treatment works may also be broken or rendered inoperable.
Standard operating procedural manual should be available with the laboratory.
Sufficient stationery for maintaining the records and dispatching the same to other centers.
Thanks to effective environmental health measures, epidemics following disasters are no longer common.
The attack rate of jaundice was found to be 1.9 percent.
The Block had piped water supply and there was no other source of water.
The block was inhabited by people belonging to middle or upper socio-economic strata.
The Centre of Microbiology of the Czech National Institute of Public Health took immediate action, in collaboration with the regional hygiene stations.
The conditions leading to an epidemic are caused mostly by secondary effects and not by the primary hazard, except in the case of flooding, which can cause an increase in waterborne and vector-borne diseases.
The control of communicable diseases depends on a healthy environment (clean water, adequate sanitation, vector control, shelter), immunization, and health workers trained in early diagnosis and treatment.
The diagnosis of paralytic poliomyelitis should be discarded only after another diagnosis has been established.
The epidemics of communicable diseases that have swept refugee camps in Africa and other parts of the world.
The five most common causes of death in emergencies and disasters are diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, measles, malnutrition and, in endemic zones, malaria.
The length of time that people spend in temporary settlements is an important determinant of the risk of disease transmission.
The list provided information on name, age, sex, address and date of onset of symptoms for all the 101 cases.
The message stated that a large number of fever cases and 21 deaths had occurred in a village in district Farukhabad.
The outbreak in SD Block was due to hepatitis E.
The PHC considered it an outbreak of falciparum malaria.
The prolonged mass settlement of refugees in temporary shelters with only minimal provision for essential personal hygiene is typical of a situation that may cause epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases.
The residents therefore, used on-line-booster pumps to lift the water to their overhead tanks.
The state health authorities informed the National Institute of Communicable Diseases on 1.11.91 about the outbreak.
The water supply was intermittent and did not fulfill the requirements of people.
There are global hypotonia and global absence of deep tendon reflexes.
They examined 756 Persons, 696 (92%) of them were presently suffering from fever usually accompanied with rigors and chills.
This high mortality rate was almost entirely due to an epidemic of diarrhea diseases and inadequate water supply.
Traumatic paralysis due to sciatic nerve injury following a misplaced gluteal injection can be differentiated by a careful history and physical examination.
Typical findings on physical examination include: acute flaccid paralysis, muscle tenderness, no sensory loss, absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes, and asymmetrical findings.
Wasting of affected muscle is a late finding. Residual paralysis after 60 days of onset of symptoms, or death or unknown follow-up in an AFP case makes the presumptive diagnosis.
While going through the streets in village Banyani, it was observed that a large number of residents were rolling bidies (local cigarette) in front of their houses.
You found that most of the cases were due to hepatitis E (laboratory findings).
You suspect contaminated piped water as the major factor in this outbreak.
A case of cholera should be suspected when, in an area where the disease is not known to be present, a patient aged 5 years or more develops severe dehydration or dies from acute watery diarrhoea;
About 80% of those deaths will occur in low to middle-income countries, to which the epidemic is now shifting, largely because of the tobacco industry's global strategy to target young people and adults in those areas.
Active surveillance of population movements can provide data for planning emergency interventions and for general disease surveillance.
Acute respiratory infections and diarrhoea are most often the major killers in emergency situations.
Additionally, the report notes that more than half of the world's population lives in countries with little or no information about the scope of the tobacco pandemic in their country.
Although cholera can be treated, it cannot be controlled by vaccinations or by mass Chemotherapy.
Although most cases of cholera are mild and treatable with simple measures, the disease can rapidly progress and result in death from dehydration.
An emergency treatment facility should be established.
Apart from patients, people visiting the facility should be limited to those giving care.
Appoint someone to treat each collected bucket of water with sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite.
Carry out precautionary measures to reduce contamination of food sold in markets.
Cholera can also spread easily where there is rudimentary sanitation and crowding, as in a refugee camp.
Cholera can spread very quickly in overcrowded living areas.
Cholera is used as an example because the disease remains endemic in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Cholera’s prevention and control in emergencies provide examples of general approaches to be adopted with other epidemics.
Compounding the international health epidemic of TB, a new strain --extensive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis -- has recently been documented in 45 nations around the world.
Each year, more than a million-and-a-half people die from the disease.
Early detection and treatment are proven to be the most effective weapons in fighting TB, but there is a critical shortage of technical, financial and human resources to do the basics.
Early vaccination campaigns should be considered before any cases appear.
Enforcing bans on tobacco advertising and promotion; and Raising taxes and prices.
Existing reporting systems can be extended to create an area-wide surveillance system that covers priority diseases, including serious water- and sanitation-related epidemic diseases.
For further information on clinical treatment of cholera see: World Health Organization (1993b).
Gatherings of people should be restricted if an outbreak occurs.
Good record keeping (number of cases and deaths) at clinics and treatment centres will help in assessing whether the epidemic is getting worse, or whether public-health measures are having a positive effect.
Health workers should regularly visit households to detect cases.
Healthy” cholera carriers (i.e. people carrying Vibrio cholerae with no manifest disease) are now common in the general population of many developing countries.
Histories should be taken from these patients, contacts identified, and the source of the disease isolated.
Ideally all measures of cholera avoid should done at every well when the water is collected.
In addition to the WHO, WLF's partners include the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, the Stop TB Partnership, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
In an area where there is an outbreak of cholera, any patient aged 5 years or more develops acute watery diarrhoea, with or without vomiting (World Health Organization, 1993b).
In areas where an outbreak of cholera is possible, supplies and equipment for outbreak control and treatment should be stored locally to deal with the first stages of an outbreak.
In light of these alarming statistics, the center has taken innovative steps to combat the disease.
In the early 1990s, cholera epidemics affected millions of people in Africa and Latin America.
It is important to designate specific health staff for public-health surveillance.
It is therefore important to plan ahead in order to prevent cholera by the proper management of the water supply, sanitation and food hygiene in camps.
It will implement an automated drug inventory system, new to the Philippines, but implemented in other nations -- that will ensure a reliable supply of fresh medications and reduce the costs of managing, storing, and distributing vital TB medicines, making health care more effective and economic.
Its MPOWER package of six strategies is a road map with guideposts helping every country in the world to act before the tobacco scourge needlessly claims millions more lives
Mass immunization is a priority in emergency situations, where people are displaced, there is disruption of normal services, there are crowded or insanitary conditions and/or where there is widespread malnutrition, regardless of whether a single case of measles has been reported or not.
Measles outbreaks are a common hazard in emergencies, often with a high case fatality rate.
Monitoring the epidemic and prevention policies.
Neighbourhood and community health workers, as well as the personnel of temporary relief centres and hospitals, should be alert to patients presenting with any of a list of diseases, including typhoid or paratyphoid fever, cholera, typhus, plague, encephalitis or meningitis, as well as to excessive numbers of poisonings (including food poisoning) or cases of malaria.
No country in the world has fully implemented all five policies at the highest level and with full enforcement.
One confirmed case of cholera should prompt all diarrhea cases to be treated as cholera.
Paralysis is not present at birth and is not associated with serious injury or mental retardation.
Patients suspected of suffering from cholera should be treated in a place set aside for this purpose.
Plans should also be made for the necessary steps to be taken if cholera does break out.
Preparedness measures taken before a disaster can greatly increase the ability to control communicable diseases and prevent epidemics.
Protecting people from secondhand smoke.
Public-health surveillance is the collection, analysis and dissemination of health information to enable appropriate action to be taken.
Send stool samples for laboratory testing, if possible, to confirm the presence of cholera.
Sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite should be added to water at the following chlorine concentrations: 0.05% (0.5 g per litre) for washing; 0.2% (2 g per litre) for cleaning walls and floors; 1% (10 g per litre) for disinfecting contaminated bedding and clothes, and for cleaning latrines.
Steps taken in advance to reduce poverty, increase the level of awareness and organization, and extend normal health and sanitary services will provide additional protection for the community if disaster strikes.
Stored drinking-water should be purified with at least 0.2mg per litre of free residual chlorine.
Such problems are more likely to occur where predisaster conditions, such as those in many densely populated mega-cities, are unsanitary.
Surveillance of public-health problems may be possible to some extent even under the worst conditions of large-scale population movement.
Suspected disease outbreaks, indicated by information from a health surveillance system, should be rapidly investigated using standards protocols for assessment (Médecins Sans Frontières, 1997a; World Health Organization, 1999b).
TB is the 6th leading cause of illness and the 6th leading cause of deaths among Filipinos.
Test indicates faecal pollution and the possible presence of bacteria that cause diarrhoea.

The most effective approach is usually to extend the routes and patterns of reporting used by existing administrative structures in the areas where people are arriving.
The need for early referral of patients with diarrhoea, and preventive measures they can take.
The new center will host a TB Treatment Center, a TB laboratory, and a new Training Center in MDR-TB, one of the most dangerous and fastest growing forms of the disease.
The new training curriculum will begin for clinicians in May, 2008.

The World Lung Foundation today announced that a grantee, the Tropical Disease Foundation, has opened the first International Tuberculosis Center in Asia to combat Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB).
These measures should be put into place rapidly, and should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory confirmation of the disease in question.
These should specify the additional health and environment measures to be taken, as well as how to treat cholera patients.
They key to effective outbreak control is a rapid response, before the outbreak develops into a major epidemic.
This is a critical improvement over the manual system, under which errors in ordering are frequently made, resulting in medicine shortages or inefficient surpluses.
This new system will employ Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology, which uses tiny computer chips to automatically identify and track the demand and supply of medicine quickly and accurately.
Those responsible for routine health surveillance should be alert to the possibility of cholera, should be familiar with the signs of the disease and should report suspected cases promptly to the authorities.
To prevent them, hygiene promotion, the provision of adequate quantities of safe water, sanitation facilities and appropriate shelter are absolutely necessary.
Treat wells in the affected area; cover them if possible.

A relationship has been proposed between exposures to bacteria and viruses during childhood.
A variety of tests now exist to diagnose allergic conditions; these include testing the skin for responses to known allergens or analyzing the blood for the presence and levels of allergen-specific IgE.
After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late phase responses can often occur.
Airways Sneezing, coughing, bronchoconstriction, wheezing and dyspnea, sometimes outright attacks of asthma, in severe cases the airway constricts due to swelling known as angioedema.
Allergic diseases are more common in industrialized countries than in countries that are more traditional or agricultural, and there is a higher rate of allergic disease in urban populations versus rural populations, although these differences are becoming less defined.
Allergic diseases are strongly familial: identical twins are likely to have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in non-identical twins.
Allergic parents are more likely to have allergic children, and their allergies are likely to be stronger than those from non-allergic parents.
Alterations in exposure to microorganisms is the most plausible explanation, at present, for the increase in atopic allergy.
An allergy testing machine being operated in the diagnostic immunology lab at Lackland Air Force Base.
Aside from these ambient allergens, allergic reactions can result from foods, insect stings, and reactions to medications like aspirin, and antibiotics such as penicillin.
Before a diagnosis of allergic disease can be confirmed, the other possible causes of the presenting symptoms should be carefully considered.
But, despite prodigious local and international efforts, only about seven high-burden countries will likely attain these goals.
Certain microbe-sensing proteins, known as Toll-like receptors, found on the surface of cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processes.
Child Lung Health Project demonstrated that use of standard case management and other training and management techniques developed for tuberculosis control could also be effective with child pneumonia.
Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies.
Common symptoms of allergy Affected organ Symptom Nose swelling of the nasal mucosa (allergic rhinitis).
Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule, and activates the sensitized cell.
Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects.
Depending of the rate of severity, it can cause cutaneous reactions, bronchoconstriction, edema, hypotension, coma and even death.
Each year more than three million children die before they reach the age of five from acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, HIV-related lung disease, and asthma.
Ears feeling of fullness, possibly pain, and impaired hearing due to the lack of eustachian tube drainage.
Effective drugs to treat and cure the disease have been available for more than 50 years, yet every 15 seconds, someone in the world dies from TB.
Eighty percent of the world's tuberculosis cases are concentrated in 22 "high-burden" developing countries, but no corner of the world is safe.
Endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IFN?, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 from white blood cells (leukocytes) that circulate in the blood.
Ethnicity may play a role in some allergies, however racial factors have been difficult to separate from environmental influences and changes due to migration.
Even more alarming, a person is newly infected with TB every second of every day.
Exposure to allergens, especially in early life, is an important risk factor for allergy.
Exposure to endotoxin and other components of bacteria may reduce atopic diseases.
Eyes redness and itching of the conjunctiva (allergic conjunctivitis).
Food allergies rarely cause respiratory (asthmatic) reactions, or rhinitis.
For instance, allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, causes irritation of the nose, sneezing, and itching and redness of the eyes.
Gastrointestinal tract abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, Diarrhea.
Given that 9 of the 22 high-burden countries are in Africa, and that Africa is home to more than 60% of those living with HIV, African health ministers followed suit by declaring TB an emergency in Africa in 2005.
Gutworms and similar parasites are present in untreated drinking water in developing countries, and were present in the water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies.
Historically, all forms of hypersensitivity were classified as allergies, and all were thought to be caused by an improper activation of the immune system.
Most factors include heredity, sex, race and age, with heredity being by far the most important.
However some allergies are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts, may have children who are allergic to ragweed, or siblings that are allergic to different things.
However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, with some studies performed in China and Ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms.
If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils.
Implementation of this Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015 will save 14 million lives in the next decade.
In 1963, a new classification scheme was designed by Philip Gell and Robin Coombs that described four types of hypersensitivity reactions, known as Type I to Type IV hypersensitivity.
In fact, the most recent data shows that globally, only 53% of new infectious cases are detected.
In Malawi, where the initial project took place, pneumonia deaths in children under five were reduced from 20-25% to 10.3% of all cases.
In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants.
In these cases, symptoms arise in areas in contact with air, such as eyes, nose and lungs.
Inhaled allergens can also lead to asthmatic symptoms, caused by narrowing of the airways (bronchoconstriction) and increased production of mucus in the lungs, shortness of breath (dyspnea), coughing and wheezing.
Insect stings, antibiotics and certain medicines produce a systemic allergic response that is also called anaphylaxis; multiple systems can be affected including the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system.
Interestingly, it has been suggested that different genetic loci are responsible for asthma, specifically, in people of Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, and African origins.
International differences have been associated with the number of individuals within a population that suffer from allergy.
It may be that the term 'parasite' could turn out to be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis is at work.For more information on this topic, see Helminthic therapy.
It seems that the likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and due to some irregularity in the way the immune system works, but the specific allergen, which causes the development of an allergy, is not.
Late phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils, and are still dependent on activity of TH2 cells.
Later, it became clear that several different disease mechanisms were implicated, with the common link to a disordered activation of the immune system.
Left untreated, a person with active TB will infect an average of 10 to 15 other people every year.
Many allergens are airborne particles, such as dust or pollen.
Many low income countries cannot afford the vaccines or the antibiotics, and efforts are further hindered by inadequate drug distribution.
Mobile populations, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and an alarming increase in multi-drug resistant strains of the disease prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare tuberculosis a global emergency in 1992.
Moreover, there is generally no clear protocols for treatment of childhood pneumonia, so if sick children present in an emergency room, they may not be treated using evidence-based techniques.
Most of these children die from severe pneumonia, which is five times more common in developing countries than in developed countries, with a death rate that is 10 to 50 times higher.
Once a diagnosis of asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis, or other allergic disease has been made, there are several methods for discovering the causative agent of that allergy.
One of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals is to reduce the mortality rate of children under five by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.
Overall, boys have a higher risk of developing allergy than girls,although for some diseases, namely asthma in young adults, females are more likely to be affected.
Pirquet called this phenomenon "allergy" from the Greek words allos meaning "other" and ergon meaning "work".
Pneumonia occurs less and is less deadly in the developed world due in part to vaccination and the availability of cheap and effective antibiotics.
protection against the development of allergy, which has been called – the "hygiene hypothesis".
Rather than being discouraged, the international community has re-invigorated its work to stop TB.
Recent research has shown that some common parasites, such as intestinal worms (e.g. hookworms), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and hence the bloodstream) that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite.
Risk factors for allergy can be placed in two general categories, namely host and environmental factors.
Several studies have shown that IgE levels are highest in childhood and fall rapidly between the ages of 10 and 30 years.
Since children that live in large families or overcrowded households, or attend day care, have a reduced incidence of allergic disease.
Skin allergies frequently cause rashes, or swelling and inflammation within the skin, in what is known as a "wheal and flare" reaction characteristic of hives and angioedema.
Substances that come into contact with the skin, such as latex are also common causes of allergic reactions, known as contact dermatitis or eczema.
Symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhoea, itchy skin, and swelling of the skin during hives or angiooedema.
The concept "allergy" was originally introduced in 1906 by the Viennese pediatrician Clemens von Pirquet, after noting that some of his patients were hypersensitive to normally innocuous entities such as dust, pollen, or certain foods.
The first is an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen.
The Foundation will continue to work with its partners to meet - and to exceed - these targets.
The four main candidate environmental factors are alterations in exposure to infectious diseases during early childhood, environmental pollution, allergen levels, and dietary changes.
The nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seemingly be subsiding, but may recur throughout a prolonged period of time.
The pathophysiology of allergic responses can be divided into two phases.
The peak prevalence of hay fever is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under 10.
The reaction is usually seen 2-24 hours after the original reaction.
The risk of allergic sensitization and the development of allergies varies with age, with young children most at risk.
The severity of this type of allergic response often requires injections of epinephrine, sometimes through a device known as the Epi-Pen auto-injector.
The work of the World Lung Foundation and its partners focuses on the 22 countries where 80 percent of the world's tuberculosis cases are concentrated.
The World Lung Foundation contributes to international efforts to reach this goal by supporting innovative approaches to improving child lung health, such as the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease’s Child Lung Health Project.
There are recent increases in the incidence of allergic disorders, however, that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone.
This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory — that co-evolution of man and parasites has led to an immune system that only functions correctly in the presence of the parasites.
This is due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils and macrophages to the initial site.
This phase can either subside or progress into a "late phase reaction" which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in tissue damage.
This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly or the onset can be delayed.
Treatments for allergies include allergen avoidance, use of antihistamines, steroids or other oral medications, immunotherapy to desensitize the response to allergen, and targeted therapy.
Two billion people - one third of the world's population - are infected with the bacterium that causes tuberculosis.
Two million people die from tuberculosis each year.
Vasomotor rhinitis, for example, is one of many maladies that shares symptoms with allergic rhinitis, underscoring the need for professional differential diagnosis.
We are working cooperatively with the national tuberculosis control programs in these countries to implement the Global Plan, and to support the innovative community solutions envisioned in the Global Plan.
WHO goals for tuberculosis control were to detect 70% of new infectious TB cases and to cure 85% of them by 2005.
WHO, the STOP TB Partnership, and other national and international agencies have developed an ambitious ten-year plan that will lay the groundwork for the eventual eradication of TB.
With this new classification, the word "allergy" was restricted to only type I hypersensitivities (also called immediate hypersensitivity), which are characterized as rapidly developing reactions.
Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive.
(Asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis together) 2.3 million (about 3.7%), prevalence has increased by 48.9% between 2001 and 2005.
(NACO) HIV/AIDS programs in India have focused predominantly on high-risk groups such as migrant laborers, truck drives, sex workers and intravenous drug users.
5-7% of infants and 1-2% of adults. A 117.3% increase in peanut allergies was observed from 2001 to 2005, an estimated 25,700 people in England are affected.
A 2003 Royal College of Physicians report presented a case for improvement of what were felt to be inadequate allergy services in the UK. [65] In 2006, the House of Lords convened a subcommittee that reported in 2007.
A low total IgE level is not adequate to rule out sensitization to commonly inhaled allergens.
A review by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester confirmed the safety and efficacy of allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insect based on numerous well-designed scientific studies.
A second form of immunotherapy involves the intravenous injection of monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies.
A small plastic or metal device is used to puncture or prick the skin.
A third type, Sublingual immunotherapy, is an orally-administered therapy which takes advantage of oral immune tolerance to non-pathogenic antigens such as foods and resident bacteria.
About 220 cases of anaphylaxis and 3 deaths per year are due to latex allergy.
About 400 deaths due to penicillin anaphylaxis.
Additionally, HIV prevalence is moving from the urban centers to the rural populations: rural 58.6%, urban 41.4%, with a population split of 72.2% rural, 27.8% urban including in groups that are most affected.
Additionally, national and international guidelines confirm the clinical efficacy of injection immunotherapy in rhinitis and asthma, as well as the safety, provided that recommendations are followed.
After completing medical school and graduating with a medical degree, a physician will then undergo three years of training in internal medicine (to become an internist) or pediatrics (to become a pediatrician).
After obtaining postgraduate exams (MRCP or MRCPCH respectively) a doctor works as several years as a specialist registrar before qualifying for the General Medical Council specialist register.
Allergist-immunologists who are listed as ABAI-certified have successfully passed the certifying examination of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI), following their fellowship.
Allergy services may also be delivered by immunologists.
Although genetic factors fundamentally govern susceptibility to atopic disease, increases in atopy have occurred within too short a time frame to be explained by a genetic change in the population.
An allergist-immunologist is a physician specially trained to manage and treat asthma and the other allergic diseases.
An estimated 150 people die annually from anaphylaxis due to food allergy.
An experimental treatment, enzyme potentiated desensitization (EPD), has been tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective.
Anaphylaxis At least 40 deaths per year due to insect venom.
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra (especially Mumbai), Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tamil Nadu, with 45 districts have a particularly high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
Asthma 10 million suffers from allergic asthma (about 3% of the population).
Asthma prevalence is 39% higher in African Americans than in whites. 5.7 million (about 9.4%).
Becoming an allergist-immunologist requires completion of at least nine years of training.
Between 1960 and 1990 prevalence has increased from 3% to 10% in children.
Between 1999 and 2006, 48 deaths occurred in people ranging from five months to 85 years old.
Changes in rates and types of infection alone however, have been unable to explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment.
Common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the back.
Desensitization or hyposensitization is a treatment in which the patient is gradually vaccinated with progressively larger doses of the allergen in question.
Drug allergies Anaphylactic reactions to penicillin cause 400 deaths.
Drugs help to alleviate the symptoms of allergy, and are imperative in the recovery of acute anaphylaxis, but play little role in chronic treatment of allergic disorders.
EPD has also been tried for the treatment of autoimmune diseases but again is not FDA approved or of proven effectiveness.
EPD uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favouring desensitization, or down-regulation, rather than sensitization.
Food allergies 2-4% of children and 1-2% of adults.
For assessing the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, allergy skin testing is preferred over blood allergy tests because it is more sensitive and specific, simpler to use, and less expensive.
For instance, people with cat allergies were encouraged to avoid them.
HIV has spread to each and every Indian State and territory.
However, of the 40 percent HIV infections among women, only 0.5% sex workers.
If a serious life threatening anaphylactic reaction has brought a patient in for evaluation, some allergists will prefer an initial blood test prior to performing the skin prick test.
If the patient is allergic to the substance, then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within 30 minutes.
Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets and growing up on a farm.
In a sense, the person builds up immunity to increasing amounts of the allergen in question.
In alternative medicine, a number of allergy treatments are described by its practitioners, particularly naturopathic, herbal medicine, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and kinesiology.
In other states such as Goa and Gujarat the epidemic is concentrated in a few districts.
In six and seven year olds asthma increased from 18.4% to 20.9% over five years, during the same time the rate decreased from 31% to 24.7% in 13 to 14 year olds.
In the United States physicians who hold certification by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI) have successfully completed an accredited educational program.
In the United States, sublingual immunotherapy is gaining support among traditional allergists and is endorsed by doctors who treat allergy.
Increasingly, allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction.
Initially the focus was on screening foreigners, especially foreign students. Gradually, the focus moved on to screening blood banks. By early 1987, efforts were made up to set up a national network of HIV screening centers in major urban areas.
Insect venom Around 15% of adults have mild, localized allergic reactions.
Internists or pediatricians who wish to focus on the sub-specialty of allergy-immunology then complete at least an additional two years of study, called a fellowship, in an allergy-immunology training program.
Interpretation by well-trained allergists is often guided by relevant literature.
Interpretation of the results of the skin prick test is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity, with +/- meaning borderline reactivity, and 4+ being a large reaction.
It concluded likewise that allergy services were insufficient to deal with what the Lords referred to as an "allergy epidemic" and its social cost; it made several other recommendations.
It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation.
It is thought that reduced bacterial and viral infections early in life direct the maturing immune system away from TH1 type responses, leading to unrestrained TH2 responses that allow for an increase in allergy.
It relies on the progressive skewing of IgG antibody production, to block excessive IgE production seen in atopys.
Many diseases related to inflammation such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and allergic diseases—hay fever and asthma—have increased in the Western world over the past 2-3 decades.
Meta-analyses have also confirmed efficacy of the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children and in asthma.
In the United Kingdom, allergy is a subspecialty of general medicine or pediatrics.
Once physicians have finished training in one of these specialties, they must pass the exam of either the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) or the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM).
One such method has a sensitivity of about 70.8% and a positive predictive value of 72.6% according to a large study.
Other newer methods use colorimetric or fluorometric technology in the place of radioactive isotopes.
Peanut and/or tree nut (e.g. walnut, almond and cashew) allergy affects about three million Americans, or 1.1% of the population.
Radiometric assays include the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) test method, which uses IgE-binding (anti-IgE) antibodies labeled with radioactive isotopes for quantifying the levels of IgE antibody in the blood.
Several antagonistic drugs are used to block the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes.
Skin testing is also known as "puncture testing" and "prick testing" due to the series of tiny puncture or pricks made into the patient's skin.
Skin tests may not be an option if the patient has widespread skin disease or has not avoided antihistamines for several days.
Small amounts of suspected allergens and/or their extracts (pollen, grass, mite proteins, peanut extract, etc.) are introduced to sites on the skin marked with pen or dye (the ink/dye should be carefully selected, lest it cause an allergic response itself).
Some "screening" test methods are intended to provide qualitative test results, giving a "yes" or "no" answer in patients with suspected allergic sensitization.
Some patients may believe they have determined their own allergic sensitivity from observation, but a skin test has been shown to be much better than patient observation to detect allergy.
Sometimes, the allergens are injected "intradermally" into the patient's skin, with a needle and syringe.
Statistical methods, such as ROC curves, predictive value calculations, and likelihood ratios have been used to examine the relationship of various testing methods to each other.
Strict avoidance still has a role in management though, and is often used in managing food allergies.
Studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy and the preventive effect of immunotherapy in reducing the development of new allergy.
Systematic literature searches conducted by the Mayo Clinic through 2006, involving hundreds of articles studying multiple conditions, including asthma and upper respiratory tract infection showed no effectiveness of any alternative treatments, and no difference compared with placebo.
Systemic reactions occur in 3% of adults and less than 1% of children.
The authors concluded that, based on rigorous clinical trials of all types of homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments, there is no convincing evidence that supports the use of alternative treatments.
The first agent of this class is Omalizumab.
The first case of HIV was diagnosed in Chennai, Tamil Nadu in 1986 among sex workers. Soon after, a number of screening centers were established throughout the country.
The hygiene hypothesis maintains that high living standards and hygienic conditions exposes children to fewer infections.
The incidence of atopy in developing countries has generally remained much lower.
The prevalence of asthma increased 75% from 1980-1994.
There have been enormous improvements in the medical treatments used to treat allergic conditions.
These bind to free and B-cell associated IgE; signalling their destruction.
These include antihistamines, cortisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, epinephrine (adrenaline), theophylline and cromolyn sodium.
These methods have shown that patients with a high total IgE have a high probability of allergic sensitization, but further investigation with specific allergy tests for a carefully chosen allergens is often warranted.
They do not bind to IgE already bound to the Fc receptor on basophils and mast cells, as this would stimulate the allergic inflammatory response.
This article or section deals primarily with the United States and does not represent a worldwide view of the subject.
This can be determined through the use of radiometric and colormetric immunoassays.
This can either reduce the severity or eliminate hypersensitivity altogether.
This kind of testing measures a "total IgE level" - an estimate of IgE contained within the patient's serum.
This response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a full-blown hive (called "wheal and flare") in more sensitive patients.
This therapy currently accounts for 40 percent of allergy treatment in Europe.
Traditionally treatment and management of allergies involved simply avoiding the allergen in question or otherwise reducing exposure.
Various blood allergy testing methods are also available for detecting allergy to specific substances.
While avoidance may help to reduce symptoms and avoid life-threatening anaphylaxis, it is difficult to achieve for those with pollen or similar air-borne allergies.
While this form of immunotherapy is very effective in treating several types of atopy, it should not be used in treating the majority of people with food allergies.
A network of domiciliary services system backs these institutions.
A pandemic (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.

Acute forms of leukemia can occur in children and young adults.
Acute leukemia is characterized by the rapid increase of immature blood cells.
Acute myelogenous leukemia Occurs more commonly in adults than in children, and more commonly in men than women.
Advancements in microscopy were essential to the early study of infectious diseases.
Aleukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is particularly common in hairy cell leukemia.
Alexander Fleming discovered the world's first antibiotic Penicillin.

B-cell ALL usually is not cured by standard ALL therapy.
Because these patients have a worse prognosis than other individuals with ALL, many oncologists recommend allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT), since remission may be brief following conventional ALL chemotherapy.
Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is uncommon, although the disease can occasionally cause cranial nerve palsies.
Chronic leukemia is distinguished by the excessive build up of relatively mature, but still abnormal, blood cells.

Damage to the bone marrow, by way of displacing the normal bone marrow cells with higher numbers of immature white blood cells, results in a lack of blood platelets, which are important in the blood clotting process.
Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin developed effective vaccines for smallpox and polio, which would later result in the eradication and near-eradication of these diseases, respectively.
Even when the causes become known, they may not be readily controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation, and therefore not especially helpful for prevention purposes.
Fanconi anemia is also a risk factor for developing acute myelogenous leukemia.
Finally, the red blood cell deficiency leads to anemia, which may cause dyspnea.
For adult ALL, standard induction plans include prednisone, vincristine, and an anthracycline drug; other drug plans may include L-asparaginase or cyclophosphamide.
For an aleukemic patient, the white blood cell counts in the bloodstream can be normal or low.
For children with low-risk ALL, standard therapy usually consists of three drugs (prednisone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine) for the first month of treatment.
For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).
Frequently, these extra white blood cells are immature or dysfunctional.
Furthermore, the diseases are classified into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias, which indicate that the cancerous change took place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form lymphocytes.
Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists.
Gerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.
German postage stamps depicting four antique microscopes.
Hairy cell leukemia About 80% of affected people are adult men.
High-risk children may receive these drugs plus an anthracycline such as daunorubicin.
High-risk patients receive higher drug doses plus treatment with extra chemotherapeutic agents.
However, the leukemic cells are staying in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream, where they would be visible in a blood test.
Immediate treatment is required in acute leukemias due to the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells, which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body.
In children, an intensive 6-month treatment program is needed after induction, followed by 2 years of maintenance chemotherapy.
In fact, leukemia is a more common cause of death for children in the US than any other type of malignant disease.
Induction chemotherapy to bring about remission - that is, leukemic cells are no longer found in bone marrow samples.
Instead, higher response rates are achieved with the aggressive, cyclophosphamide-based regimens that are used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Leukemia is a broad term covering a spectrum of diseases.
Leukemia is clinically and pathologically split into its acute and chronic forms.
Leukemia is part of the broad group of diseases called hematological neoplasms.
Leukemia or leukaemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow and is characterized by an abnormal proliferation (production by multiplication) of blood cells, usually white blood cells (leukocytes).
Leukemia, like other cancers, results from somatic mutations in the DNA which activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, and disrupt the regulation of cell death, differentiation or division.
Leukemias disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older.
Leukemias sometimes occur in younger adults, but it almost never affects children.
Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases are caused by infectious agents, and developed a vaccine for rabies.
Myeloid or myelogenous leukemias, which indicate that the cancerous change took place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form red cells, some types of white cells, and platelets.
No reported cases in young children, 96% to 100% at ten years Incurable, but easily treatable.
Only children with T-cell leukemia, a high white blood cell count, or leukemia cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to receive cranial irradiation as well as IT therapy.
or example, certain cases of ALL are associated with viral infections by either the human immunodeficiency virus or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1 and -2, causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).
Patients with low- to average-risk ALL receive therapy with antimetabolite drugs such as methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP).
PCR testing is especially important for patients whose disease is B-cell in type.
People who receive bone marrow transplantation will require protective isolation in the hospital, including filtered air, sterile food, and sterilization of the microorganisms in the gut, until their total white blood cell (WBC) count is above 500.
Proper management of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) focuses on control of bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease as well as prevention of cancer at other sites, particularly the central nervous system (CNS).
Researchers have strong suspicions about four possible causes: natural or artificial ionizing radiation, certain kinds of chemicals, some viruses genetic predispositions
Robert Koch, provided the study of infectious diseases with a scientific basis known as Koch's postulates.
Ships and other cargo carriers often harbor unintended "passengers” that can spread diseases to faraway destinations.
Some leukemia patients do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count.
Such abnormalities have a large impact upon prognosis and, consequently, treatment plans.
Such ideas became more popular in Europe during the renaissance, particularly through the writing of the Italian monk Girolamo Fracastoro.
The bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells which disrupt the normal production of blood cells.
The different leukemias likely have different causes, and very little is certain about what causes them.
The disease has not been definitively diagnosed after an initial workup.
The disease has not responded to first line antibiotics.
The disease might be dangerous to other patients, and the patient might have to be isolated.
The excessive number of cells can also interfere with the level of other cells, causing a harmful imbalance in the blood count.
The high number of white blood cells are apparent when a blood sample is viewed under a microscope.
The infectious agent is of an uncommon nature (e.g. tropical diseases).
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectiology and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology.
The patient is immunocompromised (for example, in AIDS or after chemotherapy).
The rapid growth of cities in many developing countries tends to concentrate large numbers of people into crowded areas with poor sanitation.
The word leukemia, which means 'white blood', is derived from the disease's namesake high white blood cell counts that most leukemia patients have before treatment.
The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners, as well as laboratory scientists, immunologists, bacteriologists and other specialists.
There is no single known cause for all of the different types of leukemia.
These conditions foster transmission of contagious diseases.
These mutations may occur spontaneously or as a of exposure to radiation or carcinogenic substances and are likely to be influenced by genetic factors.
This could cause the patient's immune system to be unable to fight off a simple infection or to start attacking other body cells.
This crowding makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells.
This less-common condition is called aleukemia.
This means people with leukemia may become bruised, bleed excessively, or develop pinprick bleeds (petechiae).
Typically taking months to years to progress, the cells are produced at a much higher rate than normal cells, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells in the blood.
Until the cause or causes of leukemia are found, there is no way to prevent the disease.
Viruses have also been linked to some forms of leukemia.
When the Black Death bubonic plague reached al-Andalus in the 14th century, Ibn Khatima and Ibn al-Khatib hypothesized that infectious diseases are caused by "contagious entities" which enter the human body.
Whereas acute leukemia must be treated immediately, chronic forms are sometimes monitored for some time before treatment to ensure maximum effectiveness of therapy.
While with international jet-airplane travel, people infected with a disease can carry it to distant lands, or home to their families, before their first symptoms appear.
About 20% to 30% of patients taking interferon show elimination of the abnormal chromosome and improved survival.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) is most common for adults; more men than women are affected.
Allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) is reserved primarily for patients under 55 years of age who have a compatible family donor.
Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is available for about 15% of all patients with AML.
Alternatively, patients with recurrent ALL may benefit from participation in new clinical trials of alloBMT, immune system agents, and chemotherapeutic agents, or low-dose radiotherapy, if the cancer recurs throughout the body or CNS.
Approximately half of newly diagnosed AML patients are in this age group, with 75% achieving a complete remission (CR) after induction and consolidation therapy.
As of 1998, it is estimated that each year, approximately 30,800 individuals will be diagnosed with leukemia in the United States and 21,700 individuals will die of the disease.
At the present time, clinical trials are being conducted using immunologic compounds (e.g., interferons, monoclonal antibodies) as well as new chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., bryostatin, dolastatin 10, and PSC 83 - a cyclosporine drug given with chemotherapy to overcome drug resistance).
Blast cell numbers will be reduced temporarily, but they will increase again within 3 to 6 weeks. Individuals showing lymphoid transformation have a slightly better outlook.
But, fortunately, a large group of CLL patients do not require therapy.
By contrast, maintenance treatment involves drug doses that are lower than those administered during the induction phase.
By contrast, older individuals with CLL-related complications or more advanced disease (Rai Stage III or IV) may benefit from chemotherapy and treatment with a corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone, prednisolone).
Chemotherapeutic drugs such as hydroxyurea (Hydrea) and busulfan (Myleran) can normalize the blood count for a period of time, but they do not increase survival.
Children who have hyperleukocytosis (too many white blood cells), especially monocytic M5 leukemia, have a poor prognosis.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is probably incurable by present treatments.
Consolidation or "maintenance" treatments may be given to prevent disease recurrence once remission has been achieved.
Consolidation therapy is complex, but it should include at least two courses of high-dose ara-C (HDAC).
Consolidation treatment often entails a repetition of induction chemotherapy or the intensification chemotherapy with added drugs.
Corticosteroids are first-line agents for people in whom the immune systems has been altered by CLL. CLL may cause autoimmune syndromes in which the patient's immune system attacks and destroys his or her own blood cells.
Elderly AML patients have special treatment concerns.
For example, in older patients (60+ years) who have low-risk early stage disease (Rai Stage 0) a conservative "watch and wait" approach may be taken.
For example, individuals showing myeloid transformation may be given drugs that are used to induce remission in AML - that is, daunorubicin and cytarabine, with or without 6-thioguanine or etoposide.
For patients who do not respond to interferon, autologous or allogeneic stem,   cell transplantation is the only alternative.
For younger patients who are experiencing symptoms, the physician may consider early chemotherapy, plus allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT; autoBMT).
Gleevec, is one of a new class of cancer drugs that disables an abnormal enzyme in the cancerous cell, kills it, but leaves healthy cells virtually untouched.
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an incurable, indolent blood disorder in which mutated, partly matured B cells accumulate in the bone marrow.
Hairy cell leukemia’s name is derived from the shape of the cells, which look like they are covered with short, fine, hair-shaped projections.
High-dose post-induction chemotherapy is unlikely to be tolerated by elderly patients.
HLA (human leukocyte antigen) typing of all patients under age 60, as well as typing of siblings, parents, and children, if available.
However, one in ten latent infections will progress to TB disease, which, if left untreated, kills more than half of its victims.
Hundreds of clinical trials are being planned or conducted at any given time.
If leukemia has invaded the lymph nodes at many different sites, total body irradiation (TBI) may be needed.
If possible, they should receive re-induction chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT).
If the patient experiences blood flow problems caused by high numbers of leukemia cells in the circulation, the physician may recommend leukapheresis, also known as apheresis, to separate out white blood cells, prior to chemotherapy.
In 2004, mortality and morbidity statistics included 14.6 million chronic active TB cases, 8.9 million new cases, and 1.6 million deaths, mostly in developing countries.
In addition, a rising number of people in the developed world are contracting tuberculosis because their immune systems are compromised by immunosuppressive drugs, substance abuse, or HIV/AIDS.
In addition, clinical trials are evaluating the potential benefits of substances such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies (immunologic substances that can direct the patient's immune system to kill cancer cells), and hormones (e.g., growth factors, interleukins).
In addition, specific treatment plans may be used, depending on the type of leukemia that has been diagnosed.
In children under 3 years of age, the anthracycline used for induction should be chosen with care, since doxorubicin produces more toxicity and related deaths than daunorubicin.
In general, CML treatment options are divided into two groups: those that do not increase survival and those that do.
In general, most oncologists rely on combinations of drugs for the initial, induction phase of chemotherapy.
In June of 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (Sprycel(tm)) to treat CML that does not respond to other therapy.
In limited cases, the patient may benefit from splenectomy (removal of the spleen).
In most cases, one round of treatment will produce a prolonged remission.
In the short term, especially when neutrophil counts are low, many patients also take antibiotics until their white blood cell counts have recovered to normal levels.
Individuals who are over age 75 or who have significant medical conditions can be treated effectively with low-dose ara-C.
Initial treatment of AML usually begins with induction chemotherapy using a combination of drugs such as daunorubicin (DNR), cytarabine (ara-C), idarubicin, thioguanine, etoposide, or mitoxantrone, anabolic steroids.
Leukapheresis usually takes 3 or 4 hours to complete.
Leukapheresis, also known as a peripheral blood stem cell transplant, with stem cell cryopreservation (frozen storage) prior to any other treatment.
Many different chemotherapeutic plans are available for the treatment of AML.
Many induction trials have produced good results using combinations of cytarabine (ara-C) plus an anthracycline (e.g., daunorubicin, doxorubicin).
Most oncologists base CLL treatment upon both the stage and symptoms of the patient.
New drugs that are being studied in clinical trials of CML include homoherringtonine with interferon-alpha (INF-a), paclitaxel (Taxol), QS21 (a plant extract that heightens immune responses), and amifostin (a chemical that lessens some side effects of chemotherapy).
Not everyone infected develops the full-blown disease; asymptomatic, latent TB infection is most common.
Once the patient is in remission, he or she will receive consolidation or maintenance therapy, for example, consolidation therapy with high-dose ara-C (HDAC) with/without anthracycline drugs).
One treatment that does impact on CML survival is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the use of high dose chemotherapy and radiation followed by infusion of a donor bone marrow.
Other cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, attack healthy cells as well as cancer cells, leaving patients with unpleasant and often severe side effects.
Other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium canetti, and Mycobacterium microti can also cause tuberculosis, but these species do not usually infect healthy adults.
Other treatments include rituximab infusion or self-injection with Interferon-alpha.
Over one-third of the world's population has been exposed to the TB bacterium, and new infections occur at a rate of one per second.
Overall, the strategy is to control bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease while offering specific treatment for the central nervous system (CNS), if involved.
Patients of Hairy cell leukemia engage in "watchful waiting" with routine bloodwork and exams every three to six months to monitor disease progression and identify any new symptoms.
Patients who need treatment, which includes most newly diagnosed HCL cases, usually receive either cladribine or pentostatin, which are both in a class of chemotherapeutic drugs known as purine analogs or nucleosides.
Patients with advanced-phase disease may be treated with cytotoxic drugs.
Patients with hairy cell leukemia who are symptom-free typically do not receive immediate treatment.
Patients with newly diagnosed disease also may be considered for stem cell transplantation (SCT), either from the bone marrow or other sources.
People who receive stem cell transplantation (SCT, alloBMT) require protective isolation in the hospital, including filtered air, sterile food, and sterilization of the microorganisms in the gut, until their total white blood cell (WBC) count is above 500.
People with intermediate or advanced disease may be helped by participation in a clinical trial.
Pre-treatment fertility measures (e.g., cryopreservation of semen prior to treatment; completion of a pregnancy prior to treatment) in young patients who have not completed their families.
Recent findings also suggest that low-dose cytarabine (ara-C), in combination with interferon, may be more beneficial than interferon alone.
Recurrent Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) patients usually do not benefit from additional chemotherapy alone.
Significant research into the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of leukemia is being done.
Studies may focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, improving the quality of life for patients, or appropriate care in remission or after cures.
Studies suggest that people with Stage A CLL (that is, individuals who have fewer than three areas of enlarged lymphoid tissue) do not benefit from early treatment.
Such combination chemotherapy usually offers the benefits of early remission (lessening of the disease) and a lower risk of disease resistance.
Symptoms that are related to enlargement of the lymph nodes in one area or an overgrown spleen may be treated by localized, low-dose radiotherapy or surgical management by splenectomy (removal of the spleen).
TB incidence varies widely, even in neighboring countries, apparently because of differences in health care systems.
The challenge of treating newly diagnosed Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is to determine the best overall strategy to control the disease.
The emergence of drug-resistant strains has also contributed to this new epidemic with, from 2000 to 2004, 20% of TB cases being resistant to standard treatments and 2% resistant to second-line drugs.
The patient's blood is passed through a machine that removes the stem cells and then returns the blood to the patient.
The rise in HIV infections and the neglect of TB control programs have enabled a resurgence of tuberculosis.
The stem cells may or may not be treated with drugs to kill any cancer cells.
The stem cells then are stored until they are transplanted back into the patient.
These treatments are not typically given as the first treatment for a new patient because their success rates are lower than cladribine or pentostatin.
They are treated with drugs used in the management of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) - that is, prednisone, vincristine, and daunorubicin, with or without L-asparaginase.
They may be less able to tolerate the septicemia (blood poisoning) associated with granulocytopenia, and they often have higher rates of myelodysplastic ('preleukemia') syndrome (MDS).
They often are used to control blood counts in patients who cannot undergo SCT or who do not respond to interferon therapy because of age or medical considerations.
This procedure removes the chromosomal abnormality in a large percentage of patients and for them is curative.
This procedure will determine whether a compatible donor is available for stem cell transplantation.
Treatment is generally considered necessary when the patient shows signs and symptoms such as low blood cell counts, frequent infections, unexplained bruises, anemia, or fatigue that is significant enough to disrupt the patient's everyday life.
Treatment of central nervous system leukemia, if present, may involve injection of chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., cytarabine or ara-C, methotrexate) into the areas around the brain and spinal cord.
Tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus or Tuberculosis) is a common and deadly infectious disease caused by mycobacteria, mainly Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis most commonly attacks the lungs (as pulmonary TB) but can also affect the central nervous system, the lymphatic system, the circulatory system, the genitourinary system, bones, joints and even the skin.
Unfortunately, it is estimated that only 7% of all AML patients will be cured using this procedure.
Unlike any other leukemia, HCL is characterized by low white blood cell counts.
Until recently, the treatment plans and responses of children with AML did not differ much from those of adults.
Whatever the plan, it is important for the patient to understand the treatment that is being given and the decision-making process behind the choice.
When the blood platelets are affected, it is called immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, in which a decreased numbers of platelets may lead to bleeding.
When the red blood cells are affected, the condition is known as immunohemolytic anemia, characterized by decreased numbers of red blood cells, which may cause fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
Yet new, more intensive induction and consolidation treatments have resulted in higher remission rates and prolonged survivals.
A survey of 6,000 primary care physicians in seven countries revealed disparities in several areas that affect quality of care.
Agencies have the flexibility to define this protocol within their continuity of operations plan guidelines.
Agencies may require certification of fitness to work from a health care provider.

A 2005 study showed that a DNA TB vaccine given with conventional chemotherapy can accelerate the disappearance of bacteria as well as protect against re-infection in mice.
A very promising TB vaccine, MVA85A, is currently in phase II trials in South Africa by a group led by Oxford University,and is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 2 billion people—one–third of the world's population—have been exposed to the tuberculosis pathogen.
After the establishment in the 1880s that the disease was contagious, TB was made a notifiable disease in Britain.
Although it was established that the pulmonary form was associated with 'tubercles' by Dr Richard Morton in 1689, due to the variety of TB’s symptoms.
Although tuberculosis disease remained a significant threat to public health.
Annually, 8 million people become ill with tuberculosis, and 2 million people die from the disease worldwide.
Another folk belief attributed it to being forced, nightly, to attend fairy revels, so that the victim wasted away owing to lack of rest; this belief was most common when a strong connection was seen between the fairies and the dead.
BCG vaccine was the first vaccine for TB and developed at the Pasteur Institute in France between 1905 and 1921.
BCG wasn't until after World War II that BCG received widespread acceptance in the USA, Great Britain, and Germany.
Because of the limitations of current vaccines, researchers and policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development including prizes, tax incentives and advance market commitments.
Before the Industrial Revolution, tuberculosis may sometimes have been regarded as vampirism.
Co-infection with HIV is a particular problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to the high incidence of HIV in these countries.
DNA TB vaccine may take four to five years to be available in humans.
Due to the elimination of public health facilities in New York and the emergence of HIV, there was resurgence in the late 1980s.
During the years 1838–1845, Dr. John Croghan, the owner of Mammoth Cave, brought a number of tuberculosis sufferers into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air: they died within a year.
For example, tuberculosis cases in Britain, numbering around 117,000 in 1913, had fallen to around 5,000 in 1987, but cases rose again, and reaching 6,300 in 2000 and 7,600 cases in 2005.
Furthermore, people who had TB exhibited symptoms similar to what people considered to be vampire traits.
Genetic studies suggest that TB was present in South America for about 2,000 years.
Healthcare workers considered on an individual basis in settings in which a high percentage of MDR-TB patients has been found, transmission of MDR-TB is likely, and TB control precautions have been implemented and were not successful.
Here, surgical removal of chest cavities will reduce the number of bacteria in the lungs, as well as increasing the exposure of the remaining bacteria to drugs in the bloodstream, and is therefore thought to increase the effectiveness of the chemotherapy.
Hopes that the disease could be completely eliminated have been dashed since the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s.
However, in countries where TB has gone from high to low incidence, such as the United States, TB is mainly a disease of older people.
However, mass vaccination with BCG did not start until after World War II.
However, the effectiveness of BCG is lower in areas where mycobacteria are less prevalent, therefore BCG is not given to the entire population in these countries.
However, whether tuberculosis originated in cattle and then transferred to humans, or diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear.
