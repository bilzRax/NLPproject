To determine how much cholesterol is in the foods your family eats, read nutrition labels.
Also, the American Heart Association recommends that total fat intake should be 30% or less of your total calories and that saturated fat should be 10% or less.
If you never ate another bowl of ice cream or another cheeseburger, your body would have enough cholesterol to run smoothly.
That's because your liver makes enough for healthy body function.
In fact, the liver produces about 1,000 milligrams of cholesterol a day and the rest comes from the foods you eat.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that affects the respiratory and digestive systems.
CF makes children sick by disrupting the normal function of epithelial cells - cells that make up the sweat glands in the skin and that also line passageways inside the lungs, liver, pancreas, and digestive and reproductive systems.
A defect in these cells causes problems with the balance of salt and water in the body, leading it to produce thick mucus, which clogs the lungs, setting the stage for infections and other breathing problems.
In kids with CF, this mucus can also prevent the normal absorption of key nutrients and fat in the intestines, leading to poor digestion, slow growth, difficulty gaining weight, greasy bowel movements, and a decreased ability to fight infection.
At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients have a condition called pancreatic insufficiency, which means that the enzymes created in the pancreas that digest fat, starch, and protein aren't properly passed into the intestines.
This causes problems in absorbing the necessary amounts of several important nutrients.
By providing good overall nutrition along with extra fat and calories and prescribed enzymes, you can help your child with CF grow healthy and strong.
Research has shown that eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, strokes, some cancers, and osteoporosis.
And the grocery store shelves are full of foods with packaging promising to help do that.
But it's important to take a close look - beyond the promises - at the nutritional values, ingredients, and calorie counts in the food you're buying, and to understand how they factor into your family's healthy eating.
Food labels provide this information and allow you to make informed healthy food choices to help meet your family's nutritional needs.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) require labels on almost all packaged foods that include nutrition information in readable type.
The information usually appears on the back or side of packaging under the title "Nutrition Facts" . It's also displayed in grocery stores near fresh foods, like fruits, vegetables, and fish.
Manufacturers often make claims about the healthfulness of a food on the front of a package - like "fat free" or "no cholesterol" . Many people wonder if they can trust these claims to be true.
The fact is, the FDA does require food makers to provide scientific evidence in order to make those claims.
Even so, it's a good idea to carefully read the claims and understand what they mean.
Reduced fat means that a product has 25% less fat than the same regular brand.
Light means that the product has 50% less fat than the same regular product.
Low fat means a product has less than 3 grams of fat per serving.
At the top of each food label you'll see an amount listing for serving size.
These are determined by the food manufacturer, and they're based on the amount that people generally eat.
All of the information about the nutritional value of the food that is listed on the label is given according to the serving size.
So if a serving size is 2 crackers and you eat 4 crackers - which would be two servings - you need to double all of the nutrition information.
The number of servings per container tells you how many serving sizes are in the whole package.
So if one serving is 1 cup, and the entire package has 5 cups, there are 5 servings per package.
A calorie is a unit of energy that measures how much energy a food provides to the body.
The number of calories that's listed on the food label indicates how many calories are in one serving.
The second number, calories from fat, tells the total calories in one serving that come from fat.
The label lists fat so that people can monitor the amount of fat in their diets.
Dietitians generally recommend that no more than 30% of calories come from fat over the course of the day.
That means that if the food you eat over the course of a day contains 2,000 calories total, no more than 600 of these should come from fat.
These numbers show how many calories are in 1 gram of fat, carbohydrate, and protein.
This information must be printed on every Nutrition Facts label for reference.
Percent daily values are listed in the right-hand column in percentages, and they tell how much of a certain nutrient a person will get from eating one serving of that food.
Ideally, the goal is to eat 100% of each of those nutrients each day.
If a serving of a food has 18% protein, then that food is providing 18% of your daily protein needs if you eat 2,000 calories per day.
Percent daily value is most useful for determining whether a food is high or low in certain nutrients.
If a food has 5% or less of a nutrient, it is considered to be low in that nutrient.
A food is considered a good source of a nutrient if the percentage is between 10% and 19%.
If the food has more than 20% of the percent daily value, it is considered high in that nutrient.
The information on food labels is based on an average diet of 2,000 calories per day, but the actual number of calories and nutrients that kids need will vary according to their age, weight, gender, and level of physical activity.
So use food labels as a guide to determine whether a food is generally nutritious, but don't worry so much about calculating the nutrients down to the exact ounce as long is your child is healthy and growing well.
This number indicates how much fat is in a single serving of food and it's usually measured in grams.
Although eating too much fat can lead to obesity and related health problems, our bodies do need some fat every day.
Fats are an important source of energy - they contain twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrate or protein.
Fats provide insulation and cushioning for the skin, bones, and internal organs.
Fat also carries and helps store certain vitamins (A, D, E, and K).
But because eating too much fat can contribute to health problems, including heart disease, adults and children older than age 2 should have no more than about 30% of their daily calorie intake come from fat.
Unsaturated fats are also listed under total fat.
These are fats that are liquid at room temperature.
Foods high in unsaturated fat are vegetable oils, nuts, and fish.
Unsaturated fats are often called "good fats" because they don't raise cholesterol levels as saturated fats do.
Cholesterol, usually measured in milligrams, is listed under the fat information.
Cholesterol is important in producing vitamin D, some hormones, and in building many other important substances in the body.
Cholesterol can become a problem if the amount in the blood is too high, though, which can increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis, a blockage and hardening of arteries that can lead to a heart attack or stroke.
Most of the cholesterol a person needs is manufactured by the liver.
A carbohydrate rich diet is recommended for hepatitis patient.
a communicable disease is communicated either by air or touch.
A communicable disease may also spread through contact.
A disease is communicated by food and water too.
A disease is said to be communicable if it spreads from one person to the other.
A disease is said to be non-communicable if it does not spread from one person to another.
A life style is the pattern of living that we follow - how we work, what and when we eat, how and when we sleep, etc.
AIDS is a most serious disease which has appeared only during the last couple of decades.
AIDS is caused by a virus that attacks the body’s natural defence system.
Alternating chill and perspiration is a symptom of typhoid.
although your grand father suffers from high blood pressure, nobody else gets it.
Always use only properly sterilized needles for injections to avoid AIDS.
Antibodies are special chemicals found in the blood which act against germs.
Avoid pregnancy, if infected with AIDS.
Can you tell what happens when a person suffering from a disease such as influenza, diptheria, measles, mumps, etc. coughs or speaks loudly or sneezes?
common cold spreads from person to person while high blood pressure does not.
Communicable diseases are also known as infectious diseases.
Communicable diseases are caused by very tiny organisms called germs and parasites.
Communicable diseases have two modes of spread but there are others too.
Communicable diseases spread from one person to another, that is, a healthy person may catch it from a patient.
Communicable diseases spread through air, water, food and contact.
Control the fever with medicines and cough with steam inhalation.
Dehydration can be dangerous, so give plenty of fluids, give Oral rehydration solution (ORS).
Direct contact means you actually touch a person who has the disease.
Disease can spread through indirect contact when you use things that the patient has been using.
Diseases may be the result of infection in the body such as typhoid or chickenpox, or they may be related to the physiology of the body such as hypertension and diabetes.
Diseases such as hepatitis, cholera, typhoid, etc., are spread by food and water.
Drinking water should be taken from a safer source.
Each disease has associated signs and symptoms which are particular to that disease only.
Flies carry germs from rubbish and garbage on their bodies and infect the food on which they sit.
Flies cause diseases like cholera and mosquitoes cause malaria.
Food and water get contaminated can get contaminated through unhygienic conditions of preparation, serving and storing, dirty hands and utensils and houseflies which transfer germs from rubbish and garbage to food.
For happy living, it is necessary to remain healthy and free from any diseases.
Healthy, hygienic environment and good habits also give you an ability to fight diseases.
if the germs manage to overpower the antibodies, the symptoms of disease appear.
Immunity is the ability of the body to resist a particular disease.
In other words you have immunity to viral fever.
In other words, the person does not have immunity to the disease.
In the fight between the antibodies and germs, if the antibodies are able to resist and destroy the germs then the disease is prevented and the person is said to be having immunity.
Incubation period is different for different diseases.
Influenza, polio, typhoid, measles, mumps, chickenpox, tuberculosis, AIDS are some communicable diseases.
Insist on getting properly tested blood when in need of blood transfusion.
It is also possible to keep diseases under control, if we make sensible alteration In our life styles.
Keep the patient in bed as long as there is fever and till appetite returns to normal.
Malaria, conjunctivitis (an eye disease), typhoid, chickenpox are some common diseases.
Many diseases are spread through insects.
More and more machines are being developed each day to help us with our work.
More and more young people are seen smoking and drinking although these are harmful to health.
Most of you must have heard of AIDS which stands for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome.
Natural immunity is present at birth and is only towards particular diseases.
On the other hand, very often we hear about diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart diseases, etc.
Our nutritious, balanced meals are giving way to fast food and junk food, vegetables are being rejected in favour of cheese and butter, soft drinks are replacing milk
People need to change their habits in the direction of healthier living.
Practice yoga or meditation to avoid stress in life.
So the antibodies are developed which remain in the blood after you recover from disease and help you fight against future attack of that disease.
Some people do not become ill even when exposed to germs.
Suppose your brother is suffering from influenza.
Tap water is cleaned by certain methods that kill germs before it is sent to our homes.
The AIDS virus is spread by sexual contact with an infected person, exchange of infected body fluids, e.g., blood transfusions.
The AIDS virus is spread by use of infected needles for injections, or at birth from infected mother to child during pregnancy or at birth.
The air of crowded places may contain disease causing germs.
The air of crowded places, ill ventilated houses, cinema houses and so on is more likely to contain disease causing germs.
The disease germs are passed through direct contact from your brother to his friend.
The gap of time between the entry of germs into the body and appearance of symptoms of the disease is called the Incubation Period.
The germs will attack the body and the person will catch the diseases if there is no defence system in the body.
The immunity acquired may be for a short period like in viral fever or life long as in case of measles or chicken pox.
The person suffering will let germs of that disease into the air which will enter your body when you breathe in.
The state of disease is the opposite to the state of health.
The white blood cells produce a substance called antibodies to fight germs.
there are certain deficiency diseases also like night blindness which occurs because of vitamin A deficiency.
There is no cure for AIDS as yet, nor is there any vaccine to protect the people.
These days we hear less about infectious diseases like tuberculosis (T.B) or cholera.
These germs are present everywhere- in air, water, soil, etc.
To produce acquired immunity, we have a national programme called universal Immunisation Programme.
Tuberculosis, diptheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles, polio are a few such diseases.
Uncovered food and water are likely to get contaminated with germs and spread disease.
Universal Immunisation Programme is essential for healthy living of children.
Water from wells, ponds, streams and even hand pumps is generally unsafe and may contain disease causing germs.
Water which we get from the taps is safe to drink.
We can do a lot to prevent the occurrence of life style diseases.
We can have a very healthy life if we remain conscious of our life styles.
We prefer to use a car or bus instead of walking.
When germs enter a healthy body through infected food and water, air, contact or insects, they multiply and upset the normal functioning of the body, thus, producing the symptoms of the diseases.
When weakened germs are introduced in your body through vaccination, antibodies are developed in the blood to prevent an attack of a particular disease.
When you suffer from a disease, the germs are present in the body.
when your friend had chickenpox, a rash developed on her body, face and neck.
Whereas you have indirect contact with a patient when you use anything that they have used like comb, towel, cup, etc.
who is suffering from typhoid, must have consumed food infected with typhoid germs, say 2-3 weeks earlier.
You have learnt that when a person is exposed to germs, she gets the disease.
You have noted above that the germs take some time to grow and produce the disease in body.
You know that if somebody in the family gets a cold, it does not spare the others.
You must have noticed that when a person has a disease there are certain signs and symptoms.
You must have often heard your mother telling you to keep food and water covered.
you must have seen people suffering from diseases and realised how weak the disease leaves the person.
You must remember also that aids cannot spread by through the air, that is, sneezing, coughing, through cups, glasses, plates, water or food.
You must remember that aids cannot spread by shaking hands, kissing on the cheeks, using the same toilet seat and standing close to the infected person.
You will be surprised to learn that germs do not have an easy time.
Your body’s defence system consists of white blood cells which act as soldiers to fight germs.
Your body’s defence system protected you from germs.
your brother covers his mouth with his hand when he coughs and then shakes hands with his friend.

In late 1992, large-scale epidemics occurred in India and Bangladesh caused by a new serogroup - V.cholerae O139.
In more than 90% of the cases, cholera is mild.
In severe cases, antibiotics can reduce the volume and duration of diarrhoea and can shorten the period during which the cholera vibrios are excreted.
In severely dehydrated patients ORS solution should be started as soon as the patients are able to drink, even before the initial Intravenous (I V) fluid therapy has been completed.
Infection usually spreads through contaminated water and food.
Intravenous therapy may be required for those with clinically severe form of cholera.
Isolation of Vibrio cholerae 01 or 0139 from the stools samples of any patient with diarrhoea.
It is important to emphasize that the whole packet is to be mixed in one litre of water.
IV fluids should be used only for the initial rehydration of patients with severe dehydration, including those who are in shock.
Knowledge of antibiotic sensitivity patterns in the immediate or adjacent areas is important.
Laboratory confirmation should be obtained at the earliest opportunity and the results intimated to local health office as soon as these become available.

No anti diarrhoeal, anti-emetic, antispasmodic, cardiotonic or corticosteroid drugs should be used to treat cholera.
Normal saline solution is less effective for intravenous rehydration, but can be used if Ringer's lactate solution is unavailable.
Occasionally the carrier stage may persist for several months.
ORS solution never causes pulmonary oedema.

Pulmonary oedema is caused when too much IV fluid is given, and especially when metabolic acidosis has not been corrected.
Rapid loss of fluids and salts can result in dehydration, acidosis and potassium depletion if symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting persist.
Rehydration therapy should continue to replace ongoing loss of fluids and salts.
Renal failure is rare when severe dehydration is rapidly corrected and normal hydration is maintained according to the guidelines.
Renal failure may occur when too little IV fluid is given, when shock is not rapidly corrected, or when shock is allowed to recur, especially in persons above the age of 60.
Ringer's lactate solution is the preferred fluid for intravenous rehydration.
Service area includes dirty and clean washing sections, storage area for feed, bedding, cages and the waste disposal unit.

The dead animals are incinerated.
The division conducts training courses from time to time on various zoonotic diseases.
The division has developed manuals and booklets on various diseases like JE, Rabies, Kala azar, Plague, Leptospirosis.
The dose of V.cholerae required to produce illness depends on the susceptibility of the individual.
The El Tor biotype also causes a higher proportion of asymptomatic infections than the classical biotype and survives longer in the environment.
The facility has been registered with the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals (CPCSEA), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, New Delhi with registration no. 16/1999/CPCSEA.
The first suspect case of cholera in the area must be notified immediately to the local health officer.
The latter is most likely to occur when normal saline is used for IV rehydration and ORS solution is not given at the same time.
The mice and rats are raised in a three tier colonies namely foundation stock, pedigreed expansion stock and production stock.
The sick animals are seperated and treated.
The symptoms of mild cases of cholera are clinically indistinguishable from non-specific acute diarrhoea.
There is no advantage in giving injectable antibiotics which are expensive.
There is no need to boil water for preparing the ORS solution.
Use of antibiotics for mild cases is not recommended.
V.cholerae can survive for long periods in the environment and can live in association with certain aquatic plants and animals, making water an important reservoir for infection.
When the guidelines for IV rehydration are followed, pulmonary oedema should not occur.
Young and malnourished children need special attention.
A haemorrhagic diathesis is commonly demonstrated by scattered fine petechiae on the extremities, face and trunk and in the axillae.
A major cause of deaths due to DHF is leakage of plasma in the pleural and abdominal cavities leading to hypovolaemic shock.
A number of high-powered committees have recommended action for strengthening the disease surveillance system for early identification of outbreaks.
A positive tourniquet test and a tendency to bruise at venepuncture site are always present.

Acute illness compatible with following clinical description: jaundice, dark urine, anorexia, malaise, extreme fatigue and right upper abdominal quadrant pain.
Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue transmission in India.
Aedes aegypti mosquito usually bites during day time.
Aedes albopictus mosquito is also known as Tiger mosquito.
Aedes mosquito can fly up to a limited distance of 400 meters but can spread over vast distances mechanically in various types of vehicles used by man.
All the four types of the dengue virus have been isolated and reported from different parts of India.
An effective surveillance system is essential for planning, implementation and monitoring of disease control programmes.
An entomologic study of Aedes mosquitos and larvae was done in the five zones of Beawar city.
Antigen is produced in limited quantities for operational research and outbreak investigations at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.
Approximately 50% of patients have generalised lymphadenopathy.
Bleeding from the nose, gums and gastrointestinal tract are also seen.

Demonstaration of a fourfold or greater change in reciprocal IgG or IgM antibody titres to one or more dengue virus antigen in paired sera samples.
Demonstaration of dengue virus antigen in autopsy tissue by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence or in serum samples by EIA.
Dengue and Dengue Haemorrhagic fever is an acute viral disease.
Dengue fever ( DF) is a self - limiting disease and represents the majority of cases of dengue infection.
Dengue fever /DHF can also occur in rural areas where the environment is friendly for mosquito breeding.
Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is a severe form of dengue fever.
Dengue infection causes significant morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world, including India.
dengue infections have the potential of rapid spread leading to an acute public health problem, special attention is required to be paid for its surveillance, prevention and control.
Dengue outbreaks have also been attributed to Aedes albopictus.
DF/DHF is caused by a group B arbovirus (Flavivirus) and include serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Den-1, Den-2, Den-3 and Den-4).
Diseases can also cause outbreaks with the potential to spread rapidly and cause many deaths.
During 1996, there was a large outbreak reported from Delhi when 10,252 cases and 423 deaths have been reported to the State Directorate.
During the first few days, the illness resembles classical dengue fever, but a maculopapular rash is less common.
Early in febrile illness, the differential diagnosis includes a wide spectrum of viral and bacterial infections.
Encephalitic signs associated with intracranial haemorrhage, metabolic and electrolyte disturbances, and hepatic failure (a form of Reye's syndrome) may occur.
Female mosquitoes get infected after feeding on a viraemic host.
Female mosquitoes take 8-11 days for a mosquito which has fed on an infectious case to propagate the virus to levels sufficient to transmit.
For effective disease surveillance system, the data collected should be UNIFORM and REGULAR.
For management of a case of acute watery diarrhoea during cholera outbreak, cholera should be suspected in all patients.
For the purpose of the surveillance system all cases listed under " probable" should be taken as a positive case.
HBsAg seropositivity for more than six months is an indicator of chronic infection.
HBsAg, often available, cannot distinguish between acute new infection and exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B.
Headache, backache, chills; sweating, myalgia, nausea and vomiting are signs of    malaria.
If facilities permit, investigate all suspect cases to confirm diagnosis.
If there is a sudden increase or clustering of cases or deaths due to DF/DHF, it must be reported immediately to the district health office or to the immediate supervisor.
In areas where Aedes aegypti is absent or very scarce and dengue outbreaks occur, a special effort should be made to identify the local vector(s) to develop vector surveillance accordingly.
In India, Dengue infection is known to exist for over a century.
In less severe cases, the changes in vital signs are minimum and transient.
In patients with severe bleeding, evidence of pleural effusion and/or hypoproteinaemia may indicate plasma leakage.
In some peculiar epidemiological situation, depending on the virus characteristics circulating and host immune status it manifests as a complication of dengue infection with signs of Haemorrhage and shock.
Infection with one serotype provides life-long homologus immunity but does not provide protection against otherserotypes, and instead may exacerbate subsequent infection.
Isolation of Dengue virus from serum, plasma, leucocytes or autopsy samples.
Isolation of the dengue virus from serum, plasma, leukocytes, or autopsy Samples.
Isolation of Vibrio cholerae 01 or 0139 from the stools samples of any patient with diarrhoea.
Japanese encephalitis virus infection may result in a febrile illness of variable severity associated with neurological symptoms ranging from headache to meningitis or encephalitis.
Larval surveillance during the pre monsoon and post monsoon is important to find out the extent of prevalence of vectors in a locality.
Latex agglutination kits can detect meningococci, pneumococci and H.influenzae in CSF in field conditions.
Many of diseases have seasonal and cyclic trend, which can be detected through the surveillance system.
Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Government of India has launched a National Surveillance Programme for Communicable Diseases (NSPCD) in selected districts.
Mosquito breeding can occur in any water catching or water storage containers such as desert coolers, overhead tanks, discarded buckets, tyres, utensils and large containers used for collecting rain water which are not emptied and cleaned periodically.
Mosquito breeding can occur in containers used for storing water, for cattle feeding and drinking, discarded tins, tyres, bottles etc which are not emptied and cleaned periodically.
Once the mosquito becomes infected, it remains so for life.
Outbreaks can also occur in areas with water scarcity if water is stored over long periods.
Several communicable diseases are endemic in India.
Signs and symptoms vary, all patients of malaria experience fever.
Since water is essential during the first 8 days in the life of mosquito, emptying containers once a week will greatly reduce the sources for mosquito breeding and thereby the risk of dengue fever.
Splenomegaly and anaemia are commonly associated signs of malaria.
Surveillance is prerequisite for monitoring the dengue situation in the area and should be carried out regularly for early detection of an impending outbreak and to initiate timely preventive and control measures.
Surveillance should include epidemiological, entomological and laboratory parameters.
The ambient temperature range for dengue transmission is 160C to 400C. Below 160C Aedes aegypti ceases to bite.
The anti-HBe IgM test, specific for acute infection, is not available everywhere.
The classification of the cases has been given broadly as suspect, probable and confirmed.
The details of the outbreak including investigation and control measures should follow the information as early as possible.
The diagnosis of DF/DHF can be confirmed by serological tests.
The district health office must inform the concerned health officer by the quickest mode of communication (Preferably through telephone, Fax or E-mail).
The encephalitis can not be distinguished clinically from other central nervous system infections.
The female mosquito lays eggs in clean water containers in and around houses, schools and work places.
The female mosquitoes can survive upto 3 weeks under normal temperature and humidity.
The first major outbreak associated with haemorrhagic manifestation occurred in Calcutta in 1963.
The infection is transmitted by the bite of an infected female mosquito- Aedes aegypti.
The larvae hatch from the mosquito eggs, and live in the water for about a week.
The larvae then change into a round pupal stage for one or two days after which the adult mosquito emerges, ready to bite.
The liver is usually enlarged, soft and tender.
The mosquito becomes infected by biting a patient with dengue infection.
The mosquito has characteristic white strips on the back and legs.
The mosquito is a domestic breeder.
The mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places.
The National Institute of Communicable Diseases is expected to be kept informed of the action taken.
The outbreaks of dengue fever/DHF are most likely to occur in the post-monsoon period when the breeding of the mosquitoes is highest.
The outbreaks of plague (1994), malaria (1995) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (1996) in the country aver highlighted the urgency for strengthening of disease urveillance system so that early warning signals are recognised and appropriate follow-up action is initiated in a timely manner.
The patient recovers spontaneously or recovers after a brief period of therapy.
The physical location of cases in the area or in other cities of the neighbouring states/districts/areas should also be monitored.
The presence of marked thrombocytopenia with concurrent haemoconcentration differentiates DHF/DSS from other diseases such as endotoxic shock from bacterial or meningococcaemia.
The tests include detection of IgM antibodies which appear around the end of first week of onset of symptoms and are detectable for 1-3 months after the acute episode.
The time course relationship between the fall in platelet count and a rise in haematocrit level appears to be unique to DHF.
The virus was first isolated in Calcutta, West Bengal during 1945.
There has been a dramatic rise in the incidence of DHF cases and increase numbers of outbreaks are being reported from all over the country.
Three or more loose or watery stools with or without vomitting, with or without dehydration in the past 24 hours.
To ensure uniformity in reporting we must have `case definition' of diseases to be monitored under surveillance programme.
Typically, Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)begins abruptly with high fever accompanied by headache, anorexia, vomiting and abdominal pain.
Usually, urban areas, having high population density, poor sanitation and large number of desert coolers, overhead tanks, discarded buckets, tyres, utensils etc. which promote mosquito breeding, are at high risk.
A majority of Hepatitis E cases occur in young adults.
Active case finding is particularly important during the investigation of an outbreak.
Acute viral hepatitis is such a sufficiently distinct clinical syndrome that it usually poses no difficulty in diagnosis.
All human excreta should be disposed of promptly and safely.
Almost all outbreaks of viral hepatitis in India are due to faeco-orally transmitted hepatitis E.
almost all the children in India develop immunity following sub clinical repeated exposure to this virus before 10 years of age.
Alternate arrangement for safe water supply should ideally be made during the outbreak.
Although an unusual increase in viral hepatitis cases due to hepatitis B have been recognised in hospital setting, it had not been documented as the cause of an outbreak in community setting.
Although only some of HBV infections cause icterus, most of the HDV infections (co-infection or super infection) cause an episode of clinical acute hepatitis with jaundices.
An occasional outbreak of hepatitis A has also been reported.
Around 3 to 5% of our population is estimated to be chronic carrier of hepatitis B.
Based on clinical diagnosis, around 100,000 cases of viral hepatitis are reported annually.
Carrier rates for hepatitis B can be determined by testing the blood using a similar technique and the reagents are less costly.
Case fatality rate for hepatitis B infection for hospitalised cases is around 1%; higher in those over 40 years of age.
Case fatality rates for hepatitis A and E infections are generally low.
Cases of viral hepatitis must be reported monthly to the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence through the concerned state health officer.
Chronic carriers are absent in hepatitis A and Hepatitis E.
Chronic carriers can transmit the disease to others.
Chronic liver disease due to HBV (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver carcinoma) occur only in persons who become chronic HBsAg carriers.
Clinically HDV infection, whether acute or chronic, tends to be a severe illness.
Clustering of cases in some area linked to a common water supply will help in identifying the points where the contamination is taking place.
Definitive diagnosis by type of hepatitis virus can be made only by laboratory tests.
Ensuring safe injections and screening of all blood donations for hepatitis B (and if possible hepatitis C) will largely prevent all the parenterally transmitted infections including hepatitis B, C, D and G.
General measures to prevent hepatitis B, C, D, and G include sterilisation of needles and instruments that penetrate the skin, screening of blood for hepatitis B and hepatitis C markers and promotion of safe sex behaviour.
HAV and HEV are transmitted by faeco-oral route through contamination of water and food.
HCV is usually transmitted by parenteral route; the risk of transmission by household contact and sexual activity appears to be very low.
HDV which needs the presence of HBV for its multiplication is transmitted like HBV.
Health education and public awareness and co-operation are important to prevent and control viral hepatitis.
Hepatitis A characteristically has an acute, sudden, influenza-like onset with a prominence of myalgia, headache, fever, and malaise.
Hepatitis A does not lead to a chronic hepatitis or a carrier state; chronic hepatitis with persistence of HAV infection for more than 12 months has not been observed.
Hepatitis A is usually mild in children, but can be very severe in adults.
Hepatitis A usually is not as severe or as long lasting as Hepatitis B.
Hepatitis B has a more prolonged course than hepatitis A.
Hepatitis B, C and D can lead to persistent infection (chronic carriers).
Hepatitis B, C and D viruses spread through body fluids of patients or carriers.
Hepatitis B, C, D, and G can lead to persistent infections (chronic carriers).
Hepatitis C clinically resembles hepatitis B.
Hepatitis C tends to be milder during the acute phase and tends to progress to chronicity much more frequently than hepatitis B.
Hepatitis E virus is not destroyed by chlorination in usual doses; the virus is killed by boiling.
Hepatitis G  virus has been recently discovered.
Hepatitis is an acute infection of the liver caused by hepatitis virus.
HGV has been linked to acute and chronic hepatitis.
High CFR (up to 20%) has been seen in pregnant women having hepatitis due to HEV.
Humans as well as nonhuman animals are possible reservoirs for HEV; HEV is transmissible to chimpanzees, pigs, tamarins and cynomolgus macaques.
If an outbreak of hepatitis B occurs, identification and removal of risk factor/s will control the outbreak.
If the local water sources are still used, the community should be advised to boil the water.
If there is a sudden increase or clustering of cases or deaths due to viral hepatitis, information must be notified immediately (particularly by telephone or fax) to the next higher level.
Important mechanisms of transmission of HBV are mother to infant in perinatal period, parenteral (through infected needles and syringes, blood transfusion), and sexual routes.
In majority of the cases especially in young children, the infection is mild with no overt signs or only mild jaundice.
In moderate to severe cases, the onset is usually acute with fever, loss of appetite, feeling of general ill-health and abdominal discomfort, followed within a few days by jaundice.
Intimate physical contact especially in infants and children has also been postulated to cause transmission of HBV infection.
It is important that the surveillance system is improved as this is necessary for early identification of an outbreak (viral hepatitis E) or potential high risk areas, groups, behaviour and practices such as use of unsterile syringes and needles (hepatitis B and C).
Keep an inventory of the referral laboratories which can undertake laboratory tests for all markers of viral hepatitis.
Liver function tests include a raise in ALT to 8 times or more than normal levels and serum bilirubin to more than 2mg%.
Majority of the outbreaks have occurred due to contamination of pipe water supply.
Man seems to be the only natural host for HAV to HDV.
Measures to prevent and control outbreaks should be directed towards ensuring safe water supply.
Morbidity from Hepatitis A is not higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women of the same age, nor is the course of Hepatitis A during pregnancy usually different, and foetal malformations due to Hepatitis A have not been reported.
More than 50% of HEV infections may remain anicteric.
Most of the diagnostic kits are imported, expensive and require an ELISA reader.
National AIDS Control Programme takes measures to promote safe sex behaviour to prevent HIV infection.
Once the hepatitis virus is confirmed, it is not necessary to examine specimens from all cases or contacts.
Only limited information is available for HGV; this virus can certainly be transmitted by parenteral route.
Onset of hepatitis B is usually insidious with anorexia, vague abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, sometimes arthralgias and rash, often progressing to jaundice.
Outbreaks of hepatitis A are not frequent because HAV causes very mild or sub-clinical infection in children, and most of the persons in our country are exposed to this virus during childhood.
Outbreaks of hepatitis E are due to contamination of water supply.
Outbreaks of viral hepatitis are usually caused by hepatitis E virus which spreads through contaminated water and food products.
Protective immunity follows the infection if antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) develops and HBsAg becomes negative.
Repair of water pipe lines at these points will prevent the further spread of Hepatitis E.
Reservoirs of HEV and HGV are unknown.
Right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness and hepatomegaly are important findings.
Secondary household cases during the outbreaks are uncommon.
Serum specimens should be sent to the laboratory as early as possible, preferably in cold chain.
Simultaneously, source of contamination should be removed on priority.
Since transmission of hepatitis A and E is faecal-oral, measures of personal hygiene and environmental sanitation that apply to control of other enteric infections are the basis for their control in any settings.
Suggested material or health education messages which can be adapted for local use.
The case fatality rate increases if there is concurrent infection of hepatitis B and D viruses.
The case fatality rate is also similar to that of HA, except in pregnant women where the CFR may reach 20% among those infected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.
The clinical course of Hepatitis E is similar to that of Hepatitis A.
The cost of some of the kits (especially for hepatitis C, hepatitis D and hepatitis E) is around Rs 30,000 and unit cost of each test may vary from Rs 200 to 600.
The expression of icterus appears to increase with increasing age.
The majority of individuals infected with HGV do not have clinical evidence of liver disease.
The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), Delhi has the facilities for testing all markers of viral hepatitis.
the NICD investigated 3 outbreaks of hepatitis B in 1997 which occurred due to the use of inadequately sterilised needles andsyringes by unqualified medical practitioners in the concerned areas.
The numbers reported is a gross under-estimate of the actual annual incidence of the disease.
The public and the paramedical personnel can assist in reporting cases whom they can recognise by the yellow colouring of the eyes and skin (pilia).
The risk of fulminant disease may reach 10% for clinical HDV-HBV coinfections and 20% in HDV superinfections.
The risk of outbreaks due to HEV is higher in the summer, monsoon and post-monsoon periods.
The sequelae of persistent infection include chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and liver carcinoma.
There are at least six viruses which can cause viral hepatitis.
There are six types of hepatitis virus - A, B, C, D, E and G.
There is no vaccine available for hepatitis E.
These measures will also contribute towards the prevention of hepatitis B and other parenterally transmitted viral hepatitis.
These six viruses hepatitis virus A, B, C, D, E and G.
Treatment of viral hepatitis does not depend on the results of laboratory examination.
Vaccine available against hepatitis A is not cost-effective due to epidemiological considerations and very high costs.
Vaccine is available against hepatitis B only.
Viral hepatitis may cause serious illness in pregnant women.
